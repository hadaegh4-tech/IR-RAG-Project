Hosts may also have hostnames, memorable labels for the host nodes, which can be mapped to a network address using a hosts file or a name server such as Domain Name Service. The physical medium that supports information exchange includes wired media like copper cables, optical fibers, and wireless radio-frequency media. The arrangement of hosts and hardware within a network architecture is known as the network topology.[1][2]\nThe first computer network was created in 1940 when George Stibitz connected a terminal at Dartmouth to his Complex Number Calculator at Bell Labs in New York. Today, almost all computers are connected to a computer network, such as the global Internet or embedded networks such as those found in many modern electronic devices. Many applications have only limited functionality unless they are connected to a network. Networks support applications and services, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video and audio, application and storage servers, printers, and email and instant messaging applications.\nHistory\n[edit]Early origins (1940 – 1960s)\n[edit]In 1940, George Stibitz of Bell Labs connected a teletype at Dartmouth to a Bell Labs computer running his Complex Number Calculator to demonstrate the use of computers at long distance.[3][4] This was the first real-time, remote use of a computing machine.[3]\nIn the late 1950s, a network of computers was built for the U.S. military Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system[5][6][7] using the Bell 101 modem. It was the first commercial modem for computers, released by AT&T Corporation in 1958. The modem allowed digital data to be transmitted over regular unconditioned telephone lines at a speed of 110 bits per second (bit/s). In 1959, Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for time-sharing in the United Kingdom and John McCarthy initiated the first project to implement time-sharing of user programs at MIT.[8][9][10][11] Strachey passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris that year.[12] McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the earliest time-sharing systems (the Compatible Time-Sharing System in 1961, the BBN Time-Sharing System in 1962, and the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System in 1963).\nIn 1959, Anatoly Kitov proposed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a detailed plan for the re-organization of the control of the Soviet armed forces and of the Soviet economy on the basis of a network of computing centers.[13] Kitov's proposal was rejected, as later was the 1962 OGAS economy management network project.[14]\nDuring the 1960s,[15][16] Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently invented the concept of packet switching for data communication between computers over a network.[17][18][19][20] Baran's work addressed adaptive routing of message blocks across a distributed network, but did not include routers with software switches, nor the idea that users, rather than the network itself, would provide the reliability.[21][22][23][24] Davies' hierarchical network design included high-speed routers, communication protocols and the essence of the end-to-end principle.[25][26][27][28] The NPL network, a local area network at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom), pioneered the implementation of the concept in 1968-69 using 768 kbit/s links.[29][27][30] Both Baran's and Davies' inventions were seminal contributions that influenced the development of computer networks.[31][32][33][34]\nARPANET (1969 – 1974)\n[edit]In 1962 and 1963, J. C. R. Licklider sent a series of memos to office colleagues discussing the concept of the \"Intergalactic Computer Network\", a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users. This ultimately became the basis for the ARPANET, which began in 1969.[35] That year, the first four nodes of the ARPANET were connected using 50 kbit/s circuits between the University of California at Los Angeles, the Stanford Research Institute, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.[35][36] Designed principally by Bob Kahn, the network's routing, flow control, software design and network control were developed by the IMP team working for Bolt Beranek & Newman.[37][38][39] In the early 1970s, Leonard Kleinrock carried out mathematical work to model the performance of packet-switched networks, which underpinned the development of the ARPANET.[40][41] His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today.[42][43]\nIn 1973, Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University College London (UCL), connecting the ARPANET to British academic networks, the first international heterogeneous computer network.[44][45] That same year, Robert Metcalfe wrote a formal memo at Xerox PARC describing Ethernet,[46] a local area networking system he created with David Boggs.[47] It was inspired by the packet radio ALOHAnet, started by Norman Abramson and Franklin Kuo at the University of Hawaii in the late 1960s.[48][49] Metcalfe and Boggs, with John Shoch and Edward Taft, also developed the PARC Universal Packet for internetworking.[50] That year, the French CYCLADES network, directed by Louis Pouzin was the first to make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data, rather than this being a centralized service of the network itself.[51]\nThe internet (1974 – present)\n[edit]In 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published their seminal 1974 paper on internetworking, A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication.[52] Later that year, Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine wrote the first Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification, RFC 675, coining the term Internet as a shorthand for internetworking.[53] In July 1976, Metcalfe and Boggs published their paper \"Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks\"[54] and in December 1977, together with Butler Lampson and Charles P. Thacker, they received U.S. patent 4063220A for their invention.[55][56]\nIn 1976, John Murphy of Datapoint Corporation created ARCNET, a token-passing network first used to share storage devices. In 1979, Robert Metcalfe pursued making Ethernet an open standard.[57] In 1980, Ethernet was upgraded from the original 2.94 Mbit/s protocol to the 10 Mbit/s protocol, which was developed by Ron Crane, Bob Garner, Roy Ogus,[58] Hal Murray, Dave Redell and Yogen Dalal.[59] In 1986, the National Science Foundation (NSF) launched the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) as a general-purpose research network connecting various NSF-funded sites to each other and to regional research and education networks.[35]\nIn 1995, the transmission speed capacity for Ethernet increased from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. By 1998, Ethernet supported transmission speeds of 1 Gbit/s. Subsequently, higher speeds of up to 800 Gbit/s were added (as of 2025[update]). The scaling of Ethernet has been a contributing factor to its continued use.[57] In the 1980s and 1990s, as embedded systems were becoming increasingly important in factories, cars, and airplanes, network protocols were developed to allow the embedded computers to communicate. In the late 1990s and 2000s, ubiquitous computing and an Internet of Things became popular.[60][61]\nCommercial usage\n[edit]In 1960, the commercial airline reservation system semi-automatic business research environment (SABRE) went online with two connected mainframes. In 1965, Western Electric introduced the first widely used telephone switch that implemented computer control in the switching fabric. In 1972, commercial services were first deployed on experimental public data networks in Europe.[62][63] Public data networks in Europe, North America and Japan began using X.25 in the late 1970s and interconnected with X.75.[18] This underlying infrastructure was used for expanding TCP/IP networks in the 1980s.[64] In 1977, the first long-distance fiber network was deployed by GTE in Long Beach, California.\nHardware\n[edit]Network links\n[edit]The transmission media used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and free space. In the OSI model, the software to handle the media is defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer. Common examples of networking technologies include:\n- Ethernet is a widely adopted family of networking technologies that use copper and fiber media in local area networks (LAN). The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3.\n- Wireless LAN standards, which use radio waves. Some standards use infrared signals as a transmission medium.\n- Power line communication uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.\nWired\n[edit]The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n- Coaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.[citation needed]\n- ITU-T G.hn technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed local area network.\n- Twisted pair cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.\n- An optical fiber is a glass fiber that carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea communications cables to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, single-mode optical fiber (SMF) and multi-mode optical fiber (MMF).[65]\nWireless\n[edit]Network connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n- Terrestrial microwave – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 40 miles (64 km) apart.\n- Communications satellites – Satellites also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n- Cellular networks use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power transceiver.\n- Radio and spread spectrum technologies – Wireless LANs use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi.\n- Free-space optical communication uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n- Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves and optical means, the Interplanetary Internet.[66]\n- IP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool's Request for Comments, issued as RFC 1149. It was implemented in real life in 2001.[67]\nThe last two cases have a large round-trip delay time, which gives slow two-way communication but does not prevent sending large amounts of information (they can have high throughput).\nNetwork nodes\n[edit]Apart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic system building blocks, such as network interface controllers, repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\nNetwork interfaces\n[edit]A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for plugging in a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\nIn Ethernet networks, each NIC has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.\nRepeaters and hubs\n[edit]A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted-pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet 5-4-3 rule.\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.\nBridges and switches\n[edit]Network bridges and network switches are distinct from a hub in that they only forward frames to the ports involved in the communication whereas a hub forwards to all ports. Bridges only have two ports but a switch can be thought of as a multi-port bridge. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional switches.\nBridges and switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model and bridge traffic between two or more network segments to form a single local network. Both are devices that forward frames of data between ports based on the destination MAC address in each frame.[68] They learn the association of physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames and only forward the frame when necessary. If an unknown destination MAC is targeted, the device broadcasts the request to all ports except the source, and discovers the location from the reply.\nBridges and switches divide the network's collision domain but maintain a single broadcast domain. Network segmentation through bridging and switching helps break down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\nRouters\n[edit]A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet. The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table. A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets and does not require broadcasting packets which is inefficient for very big networks.\nModems\n[edit]Modems (modulator-demodulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more carrier signals are modulated by the digital signal to produce an analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Early modems modulated audio signals sent over a standard voice telephone line. Modems are still commonly used for telephone lines, using a digital subscriber line technology and cable television systems using DOCSIS technology.\nFirewalls\n[edit]A firewall is a network device or software for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are inserted in connections between secure internal networks and potentially insecure external networks such as the Internet. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks.\nCommunication\n[edit]Protocols\n[edit]A communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. Communication protocols have various characteristics, such as being connection-oriented or connectionless, or using circuit switching or packet switching.\nIn a protocol stack, often constructed per the OSI model, communications functions are divided into protocol layers, where each layer leverages the services of the layer below it until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is HTTP, the World Wide Web protocol. HTTP runs over TCP over IP, the Internet protocols, which in turn run over IEEE 802.11, the Wi-Fi protocol. This stack is used between a wireless router and a personal computer when accessing the web.\nPackets\n[edit]Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.\nPackets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.\nWith packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link is not overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.\nThe physical link technologies of packet networks typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.\nCommon protocols\n[edit]Internet protocol suite\n[edit]The Internet protocol suite, also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less and connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission using Internet protocol (IP). At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability. The Internet protocol suite is the defining set of protocols for the Internet.[69]\nIEEE 802\n[edit]IEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model.\nFor example, MAC bridging (IEEE 802.1D) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a Spanning Tree Protocol. IEEE 802.1Q describes VLANs, and IEEE 802.1X defines a port-based network access control protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs[70] (but it is also found in WLANs[71]) – it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\nEthernet\n[edit]Ethernet is a family of technologies used in wired LANs. It is described by a set of standards together called IEEE 802.3 published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\nWireless LAN\n[edit]Wireless LAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the IEEE 802 protocol family for home users today. IEEE 802.11 shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\nSONET/SDH\n[edit]Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support circuit-switched digital telephony. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames.\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode\n[edit]Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing and encodes data into small, fixed-sized cells. This differs from other protocols such as the Internet protocol suite or Ethernet that use variable-sized packets or frames. ATM has similarities with both circuit and packet switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, low-latency content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\nATM still plays a role in the last mile, which is the connection between an Internet service provider and the home user.[72][needs update]\nCellular standards\n[edit]There are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN).[73]\nRouting\n[edit]Routing is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including circuit switching networks and packet switched networks.\nIn packet-switched networks, routing protocols direct packet forwarding through intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though because they lack specialized hardware, may offer limited performance. The routing process directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. Multipath routing techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\nRouting can be contrasted with bridging in its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, the structured addressing used by routers outperforms unstructured addressing used by bridging. Structured IP addresses are used on the Internet. Unstructured MAC addresses are used for bridging on Ethernet and similar local area networks.\nArchitecture\n[edit]Topology\n[edit]The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore, most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology which is the map of logical interconnections of network hosts.\nCommon topologies are:\n- Bus network: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although modern physical layer variants use point-to-point links instead, forming a star or a tree.\n- Star network: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a small switched Ethernet LAN, where each client connects to a central network switch, and logically in a wireless LAN, where each wireless client associates with the central wireless access point.\n- Ring network: each node is connected to its left and right neighbor node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. Token ring networks, and the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), made use of such a topology.\n- Mesh network: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbors in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n- Fully connected network: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n- Tree network: nodes are arranged hierarchically. This is the natural topology for a larger Ethernet network with multiple switches and without redundant meshing.\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with FDDI, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\nOverlay network\n[edit]An overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many peer-to-peer networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.[74]\nOverlay networks have been used since the early days of networking, back when computers were connected via telephone lines using modems, even before data networks were developed.\nThe most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network.[74] Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. Address resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\nAnother example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a map) indexed by keys.\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through quality of service guarantees achieve higher-quality streaming media. Previous proposals such as IntServ, DiffServ, and IP multicast have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network.[citation needed] On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from Internet service providers. The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination[citation needed].\nFor example, Akamai Technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of multicast). Academic research includes end system multicast,[75] resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.\nScale\n[edit]| Computer network types by scale |\n|---|\nNetworks may be characterized by many properties or features, such as physical capacity, organizational purpose, user authorization, access rights, and others. Another distinct classification method is that of the physical extent or geographic scale.\nNanoscale network\n[edit]A nanoscale network has key components implemented at the nanoscale, including message carriers, and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for other communication techniques.[76]\nPersonal area network\n[edit]A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computers and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.[77] A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\nLocal area network\n[edit]A local area network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Wired LANs are most commonly based on Ethernet technology. Other networking technologies such as ITU-T G.hn also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.[78]\nA LAN can be connected to a wide area network (WAN) using a router. The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a WAN, include higher data transfer rates, limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on leased lines to provide connectivity.[citation needed] Current Ethernet or other IEEE 802.3 LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to and in excess of 100 Gbit/s,[79] standardized by IEEE in 2010.\n- A home area network (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable Internet access or digital subscriber line (DSL) provider.\n- A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the storage appears as locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.[citation needed]\nCampus area network\n[edit]A campus area network (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, Cat5 cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant or owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.). For example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\nBackbone network\n[edit]A backbone network is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks. A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area. When designing a network backbone, network performance and network congestion are critical factors to take into account. Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone. Another example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone, which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between wide area networks (WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n- An enterprise private network or intranet is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\nMetropolitan area network\n[edit]A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a large computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area.\nWide area network\n[edit]A wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances. A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and airwaves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the OSI model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer.\nGlobal area network\n[edit]A global area network (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile users across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless LANs.[80]\nScope\n[edit]An intranet is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).[81] Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection. An extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).[81]\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the Internet, which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\nIntranet\n[edit]An intranet is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity. An intranet typically uses the Internet Protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits the use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information.\nExtranet\n[edit]An extranet is a network that is under the administrative control of a single organization but supports a limited connection to a specific external network. For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers. These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint. The network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\nInternet\n[edit]An internetwork is the connection of multiple different types of computer networks to form a single computer network using higher-layer network protocols and connecting them together using routers.\nThe Internet is the largest example of internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the Internet protocol suite. It is the successor of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) developed by DARPA of the United States Department of Defense. The Internet utilizes copper communications and an optical networking backbone to enable the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet of things, video transfer, and a broad range of information services.\nParticipants on the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet protocol suite and the IP addressing system administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority and address registries. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the reachability of their address spaces through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\nDarknet\n[edit]A darknet is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. It is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers — sometimes called friends (F2F)[83] — using non-standard protocols and ports.\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed peer-to-peer networks as sharing is anonymous (that is, IP addresses are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.[84]\nVirtual private networks\n[edit]A virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\nServices\n[edit]Network services are applications hosted by servers on a computer network, to provide some functionality for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\nThe World Wide Web, E-mail,[85] printing and network file sharing are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as Domain Name System (DNS) give names for IP and MAC addresses (people remember names like nm.lan better than numbers like 210.121.67.18),[86] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid IP address.[87]\nServices are usually based on a service protocol that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service.\nPerformance\n[edit]Bandwidth\n[edit]Bandwidth in bit/s may refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved throughput or goodput, i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. The throughput is affected by processes such as bandwidth shaping, bandwidth management, bandwidth throttling, bandwidth cap and bandwidth allocation (using, for example, bandwidth allocation protocol and dynamic bandwidth allocation).\nNetwork delay\n[edit]Network delay is a design and performance characteristic of a telecommunications network. It specifies the latency for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. Delay may differ slightly, depending on the location of the specific pair of communicating endpoints. Engineers usually report both the maximum and average delay, and they divide the delay into several components, the sum of which is the total delay:\n- Processing delay – time it takes a router to process the packet header\n- Queuing delay – time the packet spends in routing queues\n- Transmission delay – time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link\n- Propagation delay – time for a signal to propagate through the media\nA certain minimum level of delay is experienced by signals due to the time it takes to transmit a packet serially through a link. This delay is extended by more variable levels of delay due to network congestion. IP network delays can range from less than a microsecond to several hundred milliseconds.\nPerformance metrics\n[edit]The parameters that affect performance typically can include throughput, jitter, bit error rate and latency.\nIn circuit-switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.[88] Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\nIn an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique, and modem enhancements.[89][verification needed][full citation needed]\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled instead of measured. For example, state transition diagrams are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.[90]\nNetwork congestion\n[edit]Network congestion occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its quality of service. When networks are congested and queues become too full, packets have to be discarded, and participants must rely on retransmission to maintain reliable communications. Typical effects of congestion include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in offered load lead either to only a small increase in the network throughput or to a potential reduction in network throughput.\nNetwork protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse.\nModern networks use congestion control, congestion avoidance and traffic control techniques where endpoints typically slow down or sometimes even stop transmission entirely when the network is congested to try to avoid congestive collapse. Specific techniques include: exponential backoff in protocols such as 802.11's CSMA/CA and the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers.\nAnother method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing quality of service priority schemes allowing selected traffic to bypass congestion. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for critical services. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn home networking standard.\nFor the Internet, RFC 2914 addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\nNetwork resilience\n[edit]Network resilience is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.\"[91]\nSecurity\n[edit]Computer networks are also used by security hackers to deploy computer viruses or computer worms on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a denial-of-service attack.\nNetwork security\n[edit]Network Security consists of provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.[92] Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies, and individuals.\nNetwork surveillance\n[edit]Network surveillance is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the Internet. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control, recognize and monitor threats, and prevent or investigate criminal activity. With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as high-speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.[93]\nHowever, many civil rights and privacy groups—such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union—have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a mass surveillance society, with limited political and personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to lawsuits such as Hepting v. AT&T.[93][94] The hacktivist group Anonymous has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers \"draconian surveillance\".[95][96]\nEnd to end encryption\n[edit]End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a digital communications paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party encrypting data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as Internet service providers or application service providers, from reading or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both confidentiality and integrity.\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include HTTPS for web traffic, PGP for email, OTR for instant messaging, ZRTP for telephony, and TETRA for radio.\nTypical server-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee the protection of communications between clients and servers, not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger, Facebook, and Dropbox.\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the endpoints of the communication themselves, such as the technical exploitation of clients, poor quality random number generators, or key escrow. E2EE also does not address traffic analysis, which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\nSSL/TLS\n[edit]The introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. Netscape took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was Netscape Navigator. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.[65]\nSee also\n[edit]- Cloud computing\n- Cyberspace\n- Distributed computing\n- History of the Internet\n- Information Age\n- ISO/IEC 11801 – International standard for electrical and optical cables\n- Network diagram software\n- Network mapping\n- Network on a chip\n- Network planning and design\n- Network simulation\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Peterson, Larry; Davie, Bruce (2000).

The foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Internet Protocol (IP). Early versions of this networking model were known as the Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Architecture Model because the research and development were funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.\nThe Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking.[1][2] An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a protocol stack. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer, handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.\nThe technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.\nHistory\n[edit]Early research\n[edit]The Internet protocol suite has its roots in research and development into computer networks sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the late 1960s. After DARPA initiated the pioneering ARPANET in 1969, Steve Crocker established a \"Network Working Group\" which developed a host-host protocol, the Network Control Program (NCP).[3] In the early 1970s, DARPA started work on several other data transmission technologies, including mobile packet radio, packet satellite service, local area networks, and other data networks in the public and private domains. In 1972, Bob Kahn joined the DARPA Information Processing Technology Office, where he worked on both satellite packet networks and ground-based radio packet networks, and recognized the value of being able to communicate across both. In the spring of 1973, Vinton Cerf, at Stanford University, began collaborating with Kahn on the goal of designing the next protocol generation for the ARPANET to enable internetworking.[4][5] They drew on the experience the international research community, through the International Network Working Group (INWG), chaired by Cerf, which included researchers from the ARPANET community, Xerox PARC, the United Kingdom and France.[6][7][8]\nDuring the summer of 1973, Kahn and Cerf worked out a fundamental reformulation, in which the differences between local network protocols were hidden by using a common internetwork protocol, and, instead of the network being responsible for reliability, as in the existing ARPANET protocols, this function was delegated to the hosts.[9] Cerf and Khan credit several members of INWG with important influences on this design, which was published in May 1974.[10] The first specification of this Transmission Control Program was written in December 1974 by Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine at Stanford University.[11]\nDARPA contracted with BBN Technologies, Stanford University, and University College London to begin developing operational versions of the protocol on several hardware platforms in 1975.[12] Several versions were developed through discussion via the Internet Experiment Note (IEN) series.[13] Initially, the Transmission Control Program, the precursor to the later protocol suite, provided only a reliable byte stream service, not datagrams.[14] As experience with the protocol grew, collaborators recommended division of functionality into layers of distinct protocols, providing direct access to datagram service. Advocates included Bob Metcalfe, Yogen Dalal and John Shoch at Xerox PARC;[15][16][17] Danny Cohen, who needed it for his packet voice work; and Jonathan Postel of the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, who edited the Request for Comments (RFCs), the technical and strategic document series that has both documented and catalyzed Internet development.[18] Postel stated, \"We are screwing up in our design of Internet protocols by violating the principle of layering.\"[19] Encapsulation of different mechanisms was intended to create an environment where the upper layers could access only what was needed from the lower layers. A monolithic design would be inflexible and lead to scalability issues. In version 4, written in 1978, Postel split the Transmission Control Program into two distinct protocols, the Internet Protocol (IP) as a connectionless layer and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as a reliable connection-oriented service.[20][21][22][nb 1]\nThe design of the network included the recognition that it should provide only the functions of efficiently transmitting and routing traffic between end nodes and that all other intelligence should be located at the edge of the network, in the end nodes. This end-to-end principle was pioneered by Louis Pouzin and Hubert Zimmermann in the CYCLADES network,[23][24] based on the ideas of Donald Davies.[25][26] Using this design, it became possible to connect other networks to the ARPANET that used the same principle, irrespective of other local characteristics, thereby solving Kahn's initial internetworking problem.\nInternet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) was installed in the ARPANET in 1983, forming the network layer protocols used on the Internet. Initially referred to as the DOD Internet Architecture Model,[27] together with the Transmission Control Protocol, it became commonly known as TCP/IP.\nEarly implementation\n[edit]In 1975, a two-network IP communications test was performed between Stanford and University College London. In November 1977, a three-network IP test was conducted between sites in the US, the UK, and Norway. Several other IP prototypes were developed at multiple research centers between 1978 and 1983.[13]\nA computer called a router is provided with an interface to each network. It forwards network packets back and forth between them.[28] Originally a router was called gateway, but the term was changed to avoid confusion with other types of gateways.[29]\nAdoption\n[edit]In March 1982, the US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking.[30][31][32] In the same year, Norway (NORSAR and NDRE) and Peter Kirstein's research group at University College London adopted the protocol.[33] The migration of the ARPANET from NCP to TCP/IP was officially completed on flag day January 1, 1983, when the new protocols were permanently activated.[30][34]\nIn 1985, the Internet Advisory Board (later Internet Architecture Board) held a three-day TCP/IP workshop for the computer industry, attended by 250 vendor representatives, promoting the protocol and leading to its increasing commercial use. In 1985, the first Interop conference focused on network interoperability by broader adoption of TCP/IP. The conference was founded by Dan Lynch, an early Internet activist. From the beginning, large corporations, such as IBM and DEC, attended the meeting.[35][36]\nIBM, AT&T and DEC were the first major corporations to adopt TCP/IP, this despite having competing proprietary protocols. In IBM, from 1984, Barry Appelman's group did TCP/IP development. They navigated the corporate politics to get a stream of TCP/IP products for various IBM systems, including MVS, VM, and OS/2. At the same time, several smaller companies, such as FTP Software and the Wollongong Group, began offering TCP/IP stacks for DOS and Microsoft Windows.[37] The first VM/CMS TCP/IP stack came from the University of Wisconsin.[38]\nSome programmers are notable for early TCP/IP stack implementations. Jay Elinsky and Oleg Vishnepolsky of IBM Research wrote software for VM/CMS and OS/2, respectively.[39] In 1984, Donald Gillies at MIT wrote a ntcp multi-connection TCP which runs atop the IP/PacketDriver layer maintained by John Romkey at MIT in 1983–84. Romkey leveraged this TCP in 1986 when FTP Software was founded.[40][41] Starting in 1985, Phil Karn created a multi-connection TCP application for ham radio systems (KA9Q TCP).[42]\nThe spread of TCP/IP was fueled further in June 1989, when the University of California, Berkeley agreed to place the TCP/IP code developed for BSD UNIX into the public domain. Various corporate vendors, including IBM, included this code in commercial TCP/IP software releases. For Windows 3.1, the dominant PC operating system among consumers in the first half of the 1990s, Peter Tattam's release of the Trumpet Winsock TCP/IP stack was key to bringing the Internet to home users. Trumpet Winsock allowed TCP/IP operations over a serial connection (SLIP or PPP). The typical home PC of the time had an external Hayes-compatible modem connected via an RS-232 port with an 8250 or 16550 UART which required this type of stack. Later, Microsoft would release their own TCP/IP add-on stack for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and a native stack in Windows 95. These events helped cement TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols on Microsoft-based networks, which included IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), and on other platforms such as Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).\nNonetheless, for a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, engineers, organizations and nations were polarized over the issue of which standard, the OSI model or the Internet protocol suite, would result in the best and most robust computer networks.[43][44][45]\nFormal specification and standards\n[edit]The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols have been delegated to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).[46][47]\nThe characteristic architecture of the Internet protocol suite is its broad division into operating scopes for the protocols that constitute its core functionality. The defining specifications of the suite are RFC 1122 and 1123, which broadly outlines four abstraction layers (as well as related protocols); the link layer, IP layer, transport layer, and application layer, along with support protocols.[1][2] These have stood the test of time, as the IETF has never modified this structure. As such a model of networking, the Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.[45]\nA successor Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) was developed to address issues such as IPv4 address exhaustion.[48]\nKey architectural principles\n[edit]The end-to-end principle has evolved over time. Its original expression put the maintenance of state and overall intelligence at the edges, and assumed the Internet that connected the edges retained no state and concentrated on speed and simplicity. Real-world needs for firewalls, network address translators, web content caches and the like have forced changes in this principle.[49]\nThe robustness principle states: \"In general, an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior. That is, it must be careful to send well-formed datagrams, but must accept any datagram that it can interpret (e.g., not object to technical errors where the meaning is still clear).\"[50]: 23 \"The second part of the principle is almost as important: software on other hosts may contain deficiencies that make it unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features.\"[1]: 13\nEncapsulation is used to provide abstraction of protocols and services. Encapsulation is usually aligned with the division of the protocol suite into layers of general functionality. In general, an application (the highest level of the model) uses a set of protocols to send its data down the layers. The data is further encapsulated at each level.\nAn early pair of architectural documents, RFC 1122 and 1123, titled Requirements for Internet Hosts, emphasizes architectural principles over layering.[51] RFC 1122/23 are structured in sections referring to layers, but the documents refer to many other architectural principles, and do not emphasize layering. They loosely define a four-layer model, with the layers having names, not numbers, as follows:[1][2]\n- The application layer is the scope within which applications, or processes, create user data and communicate this data to other applications on another or the same host. The applications make use of the services provided by the underlying lower layers, especially the transport layer which provides reliable or unreliable pipes to other processes. The communications partners are characterized by the application architecture, such as the client–server model and peer-to-peer networking. This is the layer in which all application protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, and HTTP, operate. Processes are addressed via ports which essentially represent services.\n- The transport layer performs host-to-host communications on either the local network or remote networks separated by routers.[52] It provides a channel for the communication needs of applications. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the most basic[citation needed] transport layer protocol, providing an unreliable connectionless datagram service. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides flow-control, connection establishment, and reliable transmission of data.\n- The internet layer exchanges datagrams across network boundaries. It provides a uniform networking interface that hides the actual topology (layout) of the underlying network connections. It is therefore also the layer that establishes internetworking. Indeed, it defines and establishes the Internet. This layer defines the addressing and routing structures used for the TCP/IP protocol suite. The primary protocol in this scope is the Internet Protocol, which defines IP addresses.[53][failed verification][54] Its function in routing is to transport datagrams to the next host, functioning as an IP router, that has the connectivity to a network closer to the final data destination.[54][failed verification]\n- The link layer defines the networking methods within the scope of the local network link on which hosts communicate without intervening routers. This layer includes the protocols used to describe the local network topology and the interfaces needed to effect the transmission of internet layer datagrams to next-neighbor hosts.[55]\nLink layer\n[edit]The protocols of the link layer operate within the scope of the local network connection to which a host is attached. This regime is called the link in TCP/IP parlance and is the lowest component layer of the suite. The link includes all hosts accessible without traversing a router. The size of the link is therefore determined by the networking hardware design. In principle, TCP/IP is designed to be hardware independent and may be implemented on top of virtually any link-layer technology. This includes not only hardware implementations but also virtual link layers such as virtual private networks and networking tunnels.\nThe link layer is used to move packets between the internet layer interfaces of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on the link can be controlled in the device driver for the network card, as well as in firmware or by specialized chipsets. These perform functions, such as framing, to prepare the internet layer packets for transmission, and finally transmit the frames to the physical layer and over a transmission medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications for translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link-layer addresses, such as media access control (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist and are not explicitly defined in the TCP/IP model.\nThe link layer in the TCP/IP model has corresponding functions in Layer 2 of the OSI model.\nInternet layer\n[edit]Internetworking requires sending data from the source network to the destination network. This process is called routing and is supported by host addressing and identification using the hierarchical IP addressing system. The internet layer provides an unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. The internet layer has the responsibility of sending packets across potentially multiple networks. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet.\nThe internet layer does not distinguish between the various transport layer protocols. IP carries data for a variety of different upper layer protocols. These protocols are each identified by a unique protocol number: for example, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) are protocols 1 and 2, respectively.\nThe Internet Protocol is the principal component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.\nTransport layer\n[edit]The transport layer establishes data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes host-to-host connectivity in the form of end-to-end message transfer services that are independent of the underlying network and independent of the structure of user data and the logistics of exchanging information. Connectivity at the transport layer can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or connectionless, implemented in UDP. The protocols in this layer may provide error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers).\nFor the purpose of providing process-specific transmission channels for applications, the layer establishes the concept of the network port. This is a numbered logical construct allocated specifically for each of the communication channels an application needs. For many types of services, these port numbers have been standardized so that client computers may address specific services of a server computer without the involvement of service discovery or directory services.\nBecause IP provides only a best-effort delivery, some transport-layer protocols offer reliability.\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol that addresses numerous reliability issues in providing a reliable byte stream:\n- data arrives in-order\n- data has minimal error (i.e., correctness)\n- duplicate data is discarded\n- lost or discarded packets are resent\n- includes traffic congestion control\nThe newer Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is also a reliable, connection-oriented transport mechanism. It is message-stream-oriented, not byte-stream-oriented like TCP, and provides multiple streams multiplexed over a single connection. It also provides multihoming support, in which a connection end can be represented by multiple IP addresses (representing multiple physical interfaces), such that if one fails, the connection is not interrupted. It was developed initially for telephony applications (to transport SS7 over IP).\nReliability can also be achieved by running IP over a reliable data-link protocol such as the High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC).\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless datagram protocol. Like IP, it is a best-effort, unreliable protocol. Reliability is addressed through error detection using a checksum algorithm. UDP is typically used for applications such as streaming media (audio, video, Voice over IP, etc.) where on-time arrival is more important than reliability, or for simple query/response applications like DNS lookups, where the overhead of setting up a reliable connection is disproportionately large. Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a datagram protocol that is used over UDP and is designed for real-time data such as streaming media.\nThe applications at any given network address are distinguished by their TCP or UDP port. By convention, certain well-known ports are associated with specific applications.\nThe TCP/IP model's transport or host-to-host layer corresponds roughly to the fourth layer in the OSI model, also called the transport layer.\nQUIC is rapidly emerging as an alternative transport protocol. Whilst it is technically carried via UDP packets it seeks to offer enhanced transport connectivity relative to TCP. HTTP/3 works exclusively via QUIC.\nApplication layer\n[edit]The application layer includes the protocols used by most applications for providing user services or exchanging application data over the network connections established by the lower-level protocols. This may include some basic network support services such as routing protocols and host configuration. Examples of application layer protocols include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).[56] Data coded according to application layer protocols are encapsulated into transport layer protocol units (such as TCP streams or UDP datagrams), which in turn use lower layer protocols to effect actual data transfer.\nThe TCP/IP model does not consider the specifics of formatting and presenting data and does not define additional layers between the application and transport layers as in the OSI model (presentation and session layers). According to the TCP/IP model, such functions are the realm of libraries and application programming interfaces. The application layer in the TCP/IP model is often compared to a combination of the fifth (session), sixth (presentation), and seventh (application) layers of the OSI model.\nApplication layer protocols are often associated with particular client–server applications, and common services have well-known port numbers reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses server port 80 and Telnet uses server port 23. Clients connecting to a service usually use ephemeral ports, i.e., port numbers assigned only for the duration of the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.\nAt the application layer, the TCP/IP model distinguishes between user protocols and support protocols.[1]: §1.1.3 Support protocols provide services to a system of network infrastructure. User protocols are used for actual user applications. For example, FTP is a user protocol and DNS is a support protocol.\nAlthough the applications are usually aware of key qualities of the transport layer connection such as the endpoint IP addresses and port numbers, application layer protocols generally treat the transport layer (and lower) protocols as black boxes which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate. The transport layer and lower-level layers are unconcerned with the specifics of application layer protocols. Routers and switches do not typically examine the encapsulated traffic, rather they just provide a conduit for it. However, some firewall and bandwidth throttling applications use deep packet inspection to interpret application data. An example is the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).[57] It is also sometimes necessary for Applications affected by NAT to consider the application payload.\nLayering evolution and representations in the literature\n[edit]The Internet protocol suite evolved through research and development funded over a period of time. In this process, the specifics of protocol components and their layering changed. In addition, parallel research and commercial interests from industry associations competed with design features. In particular, efforts in the International Organization for Standardization led to a similar goal, but with a wider scope of networking in general. Efforts to consolidate the two principal schools of layering, which were superficially similar, but diverged sharply in detail, led independent textbook authors to formulate abridging teaching tools.\nThe following table shows various such networking models. The number of layers varies between three and seven.\n| Arpanet Reference Model (RFC 871) |\nInternet Standard (RFC 1122) |\nInternet model (Cisco Academy[58]) |\nTCP/IP 5-layer reference model (Kozierok,[59] Comer[60]) |\nTCP/IP 5-layer reference model (Tanenbaum[61]) |\nTCP/IP protocol suite or Five-layer Internet model (Forouzan,[62] Kurose[63]) |\nTCP/IP model (Stallings[64]) |\nOSI model (ISO/IEC 7498-1:1994[65]) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Three layers | Four layers | Four layers | Four+one layers | Five layers | Five layers | Five layers | Seven layers |\n| Application/ Process | Application | Application | Application | Application | Application | Application | Application |\n| Presentation | |||||||\n| Session | |||||||\n| Host-to-host | Transport | Transport | Transport | Transport | Transport | Host-to-host or transport | Transport |\n| Internet | Internetwork | Internet | Internet | Network | Internet | Network | |\n| Network interface | Link | Network interface | Data link (Network interface) | Data link | Data link | Network access | Data link |\n| N/a | N/a | N/a | (Hardware) | Physical | Physical | Physical | Physical |\nSome of the networking models are from textbooks, which are secondary sources that may conflict with the intent of RFC 1122 and other IETF primary sources.[66]\nComparison of TCP/IP and OSI layering\n[edit]The three top layers in the OSI model, i.e. the application layer, the presentation layer and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, there is no requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the External Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.\nDifferent authors have interpreted the TCP/IP model differently, and disagree whether the link layer, or any aspect of the TCP/IP model, covers OSI layer 1 (physical layer) issues, or whether TCP/IP assumes a hardware layer exists below the link layer. Several authors have attempted to incorporate the OSI model's layers 1 and 2 into the TCP/IP model since these are commonly referred to in modern standards (for example, by IEEE and ITU). This often results in a model with five layers, where the link layer or network access layer is split into the OSI model's layers 1 and 2.[67]\nThe IETF protocol development effort is not concerned with strict layering. Some of its protocols may not fit cleanly into the OSI model, although RFCs sometimes refer to it and often use the old OSI layer numbers. The IETF has repeatedly stated[46][failed verification] that Internet Protocol and architecture development is not intended to be OSI-compliant. RFC 3439, referring to the internet architecture, contains a section entitled: \"Layering Considered Harmful\".[66]\nFor example, the session and presentation layers of the OSI suite are considered to be included in the application layer of the TCP/IP suite. The functionality of the session layer can be found in protocols like HTTP and SMTP and is more evident in protocols like Telnet and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Session-layer functionality is also realized with the port numbering of the TCP and UDP protocols, which are included in the transport layer of the TCP/IP suite. Functions of the presentation layer are realized in the TCP/IP applications with the MIME standard in data exchange.\nAnother difference is in the treatment of routing protocols. The OSI routing protocol IS-IS belongs to the network layer, and does not depend on CLNS for delivering packets from one router to another, but defines its own layer-3 encapsulation. In contrast, OSPF, RIP, BGP and other routing protocols defined by the IETF are transported over IP, and, for the purpose of sending and receiving routing protocol packets, routers act as hosts. As a consequence, routing protocols are included in the application layer.[28] Some authors, such as Tanenbaum in Computer Networks, describe routing protocols in the same layer as IP, reasoning that routing protocols inform decisions made by the forwarding process of routers.\nIETF protocols can be encapsulated recursively, as demonstrated by tunnelling protocols such as Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). GRE uses the same mechanism that OSI uses for tunnelling at the network layer.\nImplementations\n[edit]This section needs additional citations for verification. (March 2014) |\nThe Internet protocol suite is generally independent of a specific hardware or software environment. It only requires the hardware and a software layer to exist, capable of sending and receiving packets on a computer network. As a result, the suite has been implemented on essentially every computing platform. A minimal implementation of TCP/IP includes the following: Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).[68] In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet Protocol version 6 requires Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), ICMPv6, and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) and is often accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer.\nSee also\n[edit]- BBN Report 1822, an early layered network model\n- Fast Local Internet Protocol\n- Internetwork Packet Exchange\n- List of automation protocols\n- List of information technology initialisms\n- List of IP protocol numbers\n- List of TCP and UDP port numbers\n- Lists of network protocols\n- Timeline of the history of the Internet\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ For records of discussions leading up to the TCP/IP split, see the series of Internet Experiment Notes at the Internet Experiment Notes Index.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c d e R.

It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, file transfer and streaming media rely on TCP, which is part of the transport layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP. Today, TCP remains a core protocol for most Internet communication, ensuring reliable data transfer across diverse networks.[1]\nTCP is connection-oriented, meaning that sender and receiver firstly need to establish a connection based on agreed parameters; they do this through a three-way handshake procedure.[2] The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established. Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency. Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability. TCP employs network congestion avoidance. However, there are vulnerabilities in TCP, including denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto, and reset attack.\n| Internet protocol suite |\n|---|\n| Application layer |\n| Transport layer |\n| Internet layer |\n| Link layer |\nHistorical origin\n[edit]In May 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes.[3] The authors had been working with Gérard Le Lann to incorporate concepts from the French CYCLADES project into the new network.[4] The specification of the resulting protocol, RFC 675 (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), was written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, and published in December 1974.[5] It contains the first attested use of the term internet, as a shorthand for internetwork.[citation needed]\nThe Transmission Control Program incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. In version 4, the monolithic Transmission Control Program was divided into a modular architecture consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.[6][7] This resulted in a networking model that became known informally as TCP/IP, although formally it was variously referred to as the DoD internet architecture model (DoD model for short) or DARPA model.[8][9][10] Later, it became the part of, and synonymous with, the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP continues to evolve, with incremental updates and best practices formalized in RFCs such as RFC 9293 (2022).[11]\nThe following Internet Experiment Note (IEN) documents describe the evolution of TCP into the modern version:[12]\n- IEN #5 Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program TCP Version 2 (March 1977)\n- IEN #21 Specification of Internetwork Transmission Control Program TCP Version 3 (January 1978)\n- IEN #27 A Proposal for TCP Version 3.1 Header Format (February 1978)\n- IEN #40 Transmission Control Protocol Draft Version 4 (June 1978)\n- IEN #44 Latest Header Formats (June 1978)\n- IEN #55 Specification of Internetwork Transmission Control Protocol Version 4 (September 1978)\n- IEN #81 Transmission Control Protocol Version 4 (February 1979)\n- IEN #112 Transmission Control Protocol (August 1979)\n- IEN #124 DOD STANDARD TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL (December 1979)\nTCP was standardized in January 1980 as RFC 761.\nIn 2004, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn received the Turing Award for their foundational work on TCP/IP.[13][14]\nNetwork function\n[edit]The Transmission Control Protocol provides a communication service at an intermediate level between an application program and the Internet Protocol. It provides host-to-host connectivity at the transport layer of the Internet model. An application does not need to know the particular mechanisms for sending data via a link to another host, such as the required IP fragmentation to accommodate the maximum transmission unit of the transmission medium. At the transport layer, TCP handles all handshaking and transmission details and presents an abstraction of the network connection to the application typically through a network socket interface.\nAt the lower levels of the protocol stack, due to network congestion, traffic load balancing, or unpredictable network behavior, IP packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order. TCP detects these problems, requests re-transmission of lost data, rearranges out-of-order data and even helps minimize network congestion to reduce the occurrence of the other problems. If the data still remains undelivered, the source is notified of this failure. Once the TCP receiver has reassembled the sequence of octets originally transmitted, it passes them to the receiving application. Thus, TCP abstracts the application's communication from the underlying networking details.\nTCP is optimized for accurate delivery rather than timely delivery and can incur relatively long delays (on the order of seconds) while waiting for out-of-order messages or re-transmissions of lost messages. Therefore, it is not particularly suitable for real-time applications such as voice over IP. For such applications, protocols like the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) operating over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are usually recommended instead.[15]\nTCP is a reliable byte stream delivery service that guarantees that all bytes received will be identical and in the same order as those sent. Since packet transfer by many networks is not reliable, TCP achieves this using a technique known as positive acknowledgment with re-transmission. This requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data. The sender keeps a record of each packet it sends and maintains a timer from when the packet was sent. The sender re-transmits a packet if the timer expires before receiving the acknowledgment. The timer is needed in case a packet gets lost or corrupted.[15]\nWhile IP handles actual delivery of the data, TCP keeps track of segments – the individual units of data transmission that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the network. For example, when an HTML file is sent from a web server, the TCP software layer of that server divides the file into segments and forwards them individually to the internet layer in the network stack. The internet layer software encapsulates each TCP segment into an IP packet by adding a header that includes (among other data) the destination IP address. When the client program on the destination computer receives them, the TCP software in the transport layer re-assembles the segments and ensures they are correctly ordered and error-free as it streams the file contents to the receiving application.\nTCP segment structure\n[edit]Transmission Control Protocol accepts data from a data stream, divides it into chunks, and adds a TCP header creating a TCP segment. The TCP segment is then encapsulated into an Internet Protocol (IP) datagram, and exchanged with peers.[16]\nThe term TCP packet appears in both informal and formal usage, whereas in more precise terminology segment refers to the TCP protocol data unit (PDU), datagram[17] to the IP PDU, and frame to the data link layer PDU:\nProcesses transmit data by calling on the TCP and passing buffers of data as arguments. The TCP packages the data from these buffers into segments and calls on the internet module [e.g. IP] to transmit each segment to the destination TCP.[18]\nA TCP segment consists of a segment header and a data section. The segment header contains 10 mandatory fields, and an optional extension field (Options, sand color background in table). The data section follows the header and is the payload data carried for the application.[19] The length of the data section is not specified in the segment header; it can be calculated by subtracting the combined length of the segment header and IP header from the total IP datagram length specified in the IP header.[citation needed]\n| Offset | Octet | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Octet | Bit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n| 0 | 0 | Source Port | Destination Port | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 4 | 32 | Sequence Number | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 8 | 64 | Acknowledgement Number (meaningful when ACK bit set) | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 12 | 96 | Data Offset | Reserved | CWR | ECE | URG | ACK | PSH | RST | SYN | FIN | Window | |||||||||||||||||||||\n| 16 | 128 | Checksum | Urgent Pointer (meaningful when URG bit set)[20] | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 20 | 160 | (Options) If present, Data Offset will be greater than 5.

The TCP header padding is used to ensure that the TCP header ends, and data begins, on a 32-bit boundary. The padding is composed of zeros.[18]\n- Options have up to three fields: Option-Kind (1 byte), Option-Length (1 byte), Option-Data (variable). The Option-Kind field indicates the type of option and is the only field that is not optional. Depending on Option-Kind value, the next two fields may be set. Option-Length indicates the total length of the option, and Option-Data contains data associated with the option, if applicable. For example, an Option-Kind byte of 1 indicates that this is a no operation option used only for padding, and does not have an Option-Length or Option-Data fields following it. An Option-Kind byte of 0 marks the end of options, and is also only one byte. An Option-Kind byte of 2 is used to indicate Maximum Segment Size option, and will be followed by an Option-Length byte specifying the length of the MSS field. Option-Length is the total length of the given options field, including Option-Kind and Option-Length fields. So while the MSS value is typically expressed in two bytes, Option-Length will be 4. As an example, an MSS option field with a value of 0x05B4 is coded as (0x02 0x04 0x05B4) in the TCP options section.\n- Some options may only be sent when SYN is set; they are indicated below as\n[SYN]\n.

Option number assignments are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).[33]\n- Data: Variable\n- The payload of the TCP packet\nProtocol operation\n[edit]TCP protocol operations may be divided into three phases. Connection establishment is a multi-step handshake process that establishes a connection before entering the data transfer phase. After data transfer is completed, the connection termination closes the connection and releases all allocated resources.\nA TCP connection is managed by an operating system through a resource that represents the local end-point for communications, the Internet socket. During the lifetime of a TCP connection, the local end-point undergoes a series of state changes:[34]\n| State | Endpoint | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| LISTEN | Server | Waiting for a connection request from any remote TCP end-point. |\n| SYN-SENT | Client | Waiting for a matching connection request after having sent a connection request. |\n| SYN-RECEIVED | Server | Waiting for a confirming connection request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a connection request. |\n| ESTABLISHED | Server and client | An open connection, data received can be delivered to the user. The normal state for the data transfer phase of the connection. |\n| FIN-WAIT-1 | Server and client | Waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent. |\n| FIN-WAIT-2 | Server and client | Waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP. |\n| CLOSE-WAIT | Server and client | Waiting for a connection termination request from the local user. |\n| CLOSING | Server and client | Waiting for a connection termination request acknowledgment from the remote TCP. |\n| LAST-ACK | Server and client | Waiting for an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP (which includes an acknowledgment of its connection termination request). |\n| TIME-WAIT | Server or client | Waiting for enough time to pass to be sure that all remaining packets on the connection have expired. |\n| CLOSED | Server and client | No connection state at all. |\nConnection establishment\n[edit]Before a client attempts to connect with a server, the server must first bind to and listen at a port to open it up for connections: this is called a passive open. Once the passive open is established, a client may establish a connection by initiating an active open using the three-way (or 3-step) handshake:\n- SYN: The active open is performed by the client sending a SYN to the server. The client sets the segment's sequence number to a random value A.\n- SYN-ACK: In response, the server replies with a SYN-ACK. The acknowledgment number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. A+1, and the sequence number that the server chooses for the packet is another random number, B.\n- ACK: Finally, the client sends an ACK back to the server. The sequence number is set to the received acknowledgment value i.e. A+1, and the acknowledgment number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. B+1.\nSteps 1 and 2 establish and acknowledge the sequence number for one direction (client to server). Steps 2 and 3 establish and acknowledge the sequence number for the other direction (server to client). Following the completion of these steps, both the client and server have received acknowledgments and a full-duplex communication is established.\nConnection termination\n[edit]The connection termination phase uses a four-way handshake, with each side of the connection terminating independently. When an endpoint wishes to stop its half of the connection, it transmits a FIN packet, which the other end acknowledges with an ACK. Therefore, a typical tear-down requires a pair of FIN and ACK segments from each TCP endpoint. After the side that sent the first FIN has responded with the final ACK, it waits for a timeout before finally closing the connection, during which time the local port is unavailable for new connections; this state lets the TCP client resend the final acknowledgment to the server in case the ACK is lost in transit. The time duration is implementation-dependent, but some common values are 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 2 minutes. After the timeout, the client enters the CLOSED state and the local port becomes available for new connections.[35]\nIt is also possible to terminate the connection by a 3-way handshake, when host A sends a FIN and host B replies with a FIN & ACK (combining two steps into one) and host A replies with an ACK.[36]\nSome operating systems, such as Linux[37] implement a half-duplex close sequence. If the host actively closes a connection, while still having unread incoming data available, the host sends the signal RST (losing any received data) instead of FIN. This assures that a TCP application is aware there was a data loss.[38]\nA connection can be in a half-open state, in which case one side has terminated the connection, but the other has not. The side that has terminated can no longer send any data into the connection, but the other side can. The terminating side should continue reading the data until the other side terminates as well.[39][40]\nResource usage\n[edit]Most implementations allocate an entry in a table that maps a session to a running operating system process. Because TCP packets do not include a session identifier, both endpoints identify the session using the client's address and port. Whenever a packet is received, the TCP implementation must perform a lookup on this table to find the destination process. Each entry in the table is known as a Transmission Control Block or TCB. It contains information about the endpoints (IP and port), status of the connection, running data about the packets that are being exchanged and buffers for sending and receiving data.\nThe number of sessions in the server side is limited only by memory and can grow as new connections arrive, but the client must allocate an ephemeral port before sending the first SYN to the server. This port remains allocated during the whole conversation and effectively limits the number of outgoing connections from each of the client's IP addresses. If an application fails to properly close unrequired connections, a client can run out of resources and become unable to establish new TCP connections, even from other applications.\nBoth endpoints must also allocate space for unacknowledged packets and received (but unread) data.\nData transfer\n[edit]The Transmission Control Protocol differs in several key features compared to the User Datagram Protocol:\n- Ordered data transfer: the destination host rearranges segments according to a sequence number[15]\n- Retransmission of lost packets: any cumulative stream not acknowledged is retransmitted[15]\n- Error-free data transfer: corrupted packets are treated as lost and are retransmitted[16]\n- Flow control: limits the rate a sender transfers data to guarantee reliable delivery. The receiver continually hints the sender on how much data can be received. When the receiving host's buffer fills, the next acknowledgment suspends the transfer and allows the data in the buffer to be processed.[15]\n- Congestion control: lost packets (presumed due to congestion) trigger a reduction in data delivery rate[15]\nReliable transmission\n[edit]TCP uses a sequence number to identify each byte of data. The sequence number identifies the order of the bytes sent from each computer so that the data can be reconstructed in order, regardless of any out-of-order delivery that may occur. The sequence number of the first byte is chosen by the transmitter for the first packet, which is flagged SYN. This number can be arbitrary, and should, in fact, be unpredictable to defend against TCP sequence prediction attacks.\nAcknowledgments (ACKs) are sent with a sequence number by the receiver of data to tell the sender that data has been received to the specified byte. ACKs do not imply that the data has been delivered to the application, they merely signify that it is now the receiver's responsibility to deliver the data.\nReliability is achieved by the sender detecting lost data and retransmitting it. TCP uses two primary techniques to identify loss. Retransmission timeout (RTO) and duplicate cumulative acknowledgments (DupAcks).\nWhen a TCP segment is retransmitted, it retains the same sequence number as the original delivery attempt. This conflation of delivery and logical data ordering means that, when acknowledgment is received after a retransmission, the sender cannot tell whether the original transmission or the retransmission is being acknowledged, the so-called retransmission ambiguity.[41] TCP incurs complexity due to retransmission ambiguity.[42]\nDuplicate-ACK-based retransmission\n[edit]If a single segment (say segment number 100) in a stream is lost, then the receiver cannot acknowledge packets above that segment number (100) because it uses cumulative ACKs. Hence the receiver acknowledges packet 99 again on the receipt of another data packet. This duplicate acknowledgement is used as a signal for packet loss. That is, if the sender receives three duplicate acknowledgments, it retransmits the last unacknowledged packet. A threshold of three is used because the network may reorder segments causing duplicate acknowledgements. This threshold has been demonstrated to avoid spurious retransmissions due to reordering.[43] Some TCP implementations use selective acknowledgements (SACKs) to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP's ability to retransmit the right segments.\nRetransmission ambiguity can cause spurious fast retransmissions and congestion avoidance if there is reordering beyond the duplicate acknowledgment threshold.[44] In the last two decades more packet reordering has been observed over the Internet[45] which led TCP implementations, such as the one in the Linux Kernel to adopt heuristic methods to scale the duplicate acknowledgment threshold.[46] Recently, there have been efforts to completely phase out duplicate-ACK-based fast-retransmissions and replace them with timer based ones.[47] (Not to be confused with the classic RTO discussed below). The time based loss detection algorithm called Recent Acknowledgment (RACK)[48] has been adopted as the default algorithm in Linux and Windows.[49]\nTimeout-based retransmission\n[edit]When a sender transmits a segment, it initializes a timer with a conservative estimate of the arrival time of the acknowledgment. The segment is retransmitted if the timer expires, with a new timeout threshold of twice the previous value, resulting in exponential backoff behavior. Typically, the initial timer value is smoothed RTT + max(G, 4 × RTT variation), where G is the clock granularity.[50] This guards against excessive transmission traffic due to faulty or malicious actors, such as man-in-the-middle denial of service attackers.\nAccurate RTT estimates are important for loss recovery, as it allows a sender to assume an unacknowledged packet to be lost after sufficient time elapses (i.e., determining the RTO time).[51] Retransmission ambiguity can lead a sender's estimate of RTT to be imprecise.[51] In an environment with variable RTTs, spurious timeouts can occur:[52] if the RTT is under-estimated, then the RTO fires and triggers a needless retransmit and slow-start. After a spurious retransmission, when the acknowledgments for the original transmissions arrive, the sender may believe them to be acknowledging the retransmission and conclude, incorrectly, that segments sent between the original transmission and retransmission have been lost, causing further needless retransmissions to the extent that the link truly becomes congested;[53][54] selective acknowledgement can reduce this effect.[55] RFC 6298 specifies that implementations must not use retransmitted segments when estimating RTT.[56] Karn's algorithm ensures that a good RTT estimate will be produced—eventually—by waiting until there is an unambiguous acknowledgment before adjusting the RTO.[57] After spurious retransmissions, however, it may take significant time before such an unambiguous acknowledgment arrives, degrading performance in the interim.[58] TCP timestamps also resolve the retransmission ambiguity problem in setting the RTO,[56] though they do not necessarily improve the RTT estimate.[59]\nError detection\n[edit]Sequence numbers allow receivers to discard duplicate packets and properly sequence out-of-order packets. Acknowledgments allow senders to determine when to retransmit lost packets.\nTo assure correctness a checksum field is included; see § Checksum computation for details. The TCP checksum is a weak check by modern standards and is normally paired with a CRC integrity check at layer 2, below both TCP and IP, such as is used in PPP or the Ethernet frame. However, introduction of errors in packets between CRC-protected hops is common and the 16-bit TCP checksum catches most of these.[60]\nFlow control\n[edit]TCP uses an end-to-end flow control protocol to avoid having the sender send data too fast for the TCP receiver to receive and process it reliably. Having a mechanism for flow control is essential in an environment where machines of diverse network speeds communicate. For example, if a PC sends data to a smartphone that is slowly processing received data, the smartphone must be able to regulate the data flow so as not to be overwhelmed.[15]\nTCP uses a sliding window flow control protocol. In each TCP segment, the receiver specifies in the receive window field the amount of additionally received data (in bytes) that it is willing to buffer for the connection. The sending host can send only up to that amount of data before it must wait for an acknowledgment and receive window update from the receiving host.\nWhen a receiver advertises a window size of 0, the sender stops sending data and starts its persist timer. The persist timer is used to protect TCP from a deadlock situation that could arise if a subsequent window size update from the receiver is lost, and the sender cannot send more data until receiving a new window size update from the receiver. When the persist timer expires, the TCP sender attempts recovery by sending a small packet so that the receiver responds by sending another acknowledgment containing the new window size.\nIf a receiver is processing incoming data in small increments, it may repeatedly advertise a small receive window. This is referred to as the silly window syndrome, since it is inefficient to send only a few bytes of data in a TCP segment, given the relatively large overhead of the TCP header.\nCongestion control\n[edit]The final main aspect of TCP is congestion control. TCP uses a number of mechanisms to achieve high performance and avoid congestive collapse, a gridlock situation where network performance is severely degraded. These mechanisms control the rate of data entering the network, keeping the data flow below a rate that would trigger collapse. They also yield an approximately max-min fair allocation between flows.\nAcknowledgments for data sent, or the lack of acknowledgments, are used by senders to infer network conditions between the TCP sender and receiver. Coupled with timers, TCP senders and receivers can alter the behavior of the flow of data. This is more generally referred to as congestion control or congestion avoidance.\nModern implementations of TCP contain four intertwined algorithms: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.[61]\nIn addition, senders employ a retransmission timeout (RTO) that is based on the estimated round-trip time (RTT) between the sender and receiver, as well as the variance in this round-trip time.[62] There are subtleties in the estimation of RTT. For example, senders must be careful when calculating RTT samples for retransmitted packets; typically they use Karn's Algorithm or TCP timestamps.[29] These individual RTT samples are then averaged over time to create a smoothed round trip time (SRTT) using Jacobson's algorithm. This SRTT value is what is used as the round-trip time estimate.\nEnhancing TCP to reliably handle loss, minimize errors, manage congestion and go fast in very high-speed environments are ongoing areas of research and standards development. As a result, there are a number of TCP congestion avoidance algorithm variations.\nMaximum segment size\n[edit]The maximum segment size (MSS) is the largest amount of data, specified in bytes, that TCP is willing to receive in a single segment. For best performance, the MSS should be set small enough to avoid IP fragmentation, which can lead to packet loss and excessive retransmissions. To accomplish this, typically the MSS is announced by each side using the MSS option when the TCP connection is established. The option value is derived from the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the data link layer of the networks to which the sender and receiver are directly attached. TCP senders can use path MTU discovery to infer the minimum MTU along the network path between the sender and receiver, and use this to dynamically adjust the MSS to avoid IP fragmentation within the network.\nMSS announcement may also be called MSS negotiation but, strictly speaking, the MSS is not negotiated. Two completely independent values of MSS are permitted for the two directions of data flow in a TCP connection,[63][18] so there is no need to agree on a common MSS configuration for a bidirectional connection.\nSelective acknowledgments\n[edit]Relying purely on the cumulative acknowledgment scheme employed by the original TCP can lead to inefficiencies when packets are lost. For example, suppose bytes with sequence number 1,000 to 10,999 are sent in 10 different TCP segments of equal size, and the second segment (sequence numbers 2,000 to 2,999) is lost during transmission. In a pure cumulative acknowledgment protocol, the receiver can only send a cumulative ACK value of 2,000 (the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number of the received data) and cannot say that it received bytes 3,000 to 10,999 successfully. Thus the sender may then have to resend all data starting with sequence number 2,000.\nTo alleviate this issue TCP employs the selective acknowledgment (SACK) option, defined in 1996 in RFC 2018, which allows the receiver to acknowledge discontinuous blocks of packets that were received correctly, in addition to the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number of the last contiguous byte received successively, as in the basic TCP acknowledgment. The acknowledgment can include a number of SACK blocks, where each SACK block is conveyed by the Left Edge of Block (the first sequence number of the block) and the Right Edge of Block (the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number of the block), with a Block being a contiguous range that the receiver correctly received. In the example above, the receiver would send an ACK segment with a cumulative ACK value of 2,000 and a SACK option header with sequence numbers 3,000 and 11,000. The sender would accordingly retransmit only the second segment with sequence numbers 2,000 to 2,999.\nA TCP sender may interpret an out-of-order segment delivery as a lost segment. If it does so, the TCP sender will retransmit the segment previous to the out-of-order packet and slow its data delivery rate for that connection. The duplicate-SACK option, an extension to the SACK option that was defined in May 2000 in RFC 2883, solves this problem. Once the TCP receiver detects a second duplicate packet, it sends a D-ACK to indicate that no segments were lost, allowing the TCP sender to reinstate the higher transmission rate.\nThe SACK option is not mandatory and comes into operation only if both parties support it. This is negotiated when a connection is established. SACK uses a TCP header option (see § TCP segment structure for details). The use of SACK has become widespread—all popular TCP stacks support it. Selective acknowledgment is also used in Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).\nSelective acknowledgements can be 'reneged', where the receiver unilaterally discards the selectively acknowledged data. RFC 2018 discouraged such behavior, but did not prohibit it to allow receivers the option of reneging if they, for example, ran out of buffer space.[64] The possibility of reneging leads to implementation complexity for both senders and receivers, and also imposes memory costs on the sender.[65]\nWindow scaling\n[edit]For more efficient use of high-bandwidth networks, a larger TCP window size may be used. A 16-bit TCP window size field controls the flow of data and its value is limited to 65,535 bytes. Since the size field cannot be expanded beyond this limit, a scaling factor is used. The TCP window scale option, as defined in RFC 1323, is an option used to increase the maximum window size to 1 gigabyte. Scaling up to these larger window sizes is necessary for TCP tuning.\nThe window scale option is used only during the TCP 3-way handshake. The window scale value represents the number of bits to left-shift the 16-bit window size field when interpreting it. The window scale value can be set from 0 (no shift) to 14 for each direction independently. Both sides must send the option in their SYN segments to enable window scaling in either direction.\nSome routers and packet firewalls rewrite the window scaling factor during a transmission. This causes sending and receiving sides to assume different TCP window sizes. The result is non-stable traffic that may be very slow. The problem is visible on some sites behind a defective router.[66]\nTCP timestamps\n[edit]TCP timestamps, defined in RFC 1323 in 1992, can help TCP determine in which order packets were sent. TCP timestamps are not normally aligned to the system clock and start at some random value. Many operating systems will increment the timestamp for every elapsed millisecond; however, the RFC only states that the ticks should be proportional.\nThere are two timestamp fields:\n- a 4-byte sender timestamp value (my timestamp)\n- a 4-byte echo reply timestamp value (the most recent timestamp received from you).\nTCP timestamps are used in an algorithm known as Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers, or PAWS. PAWS is used when the receive window crosses the sequence number wraparound boundary. In the case where a packet was potentially retransmitted, it answers the question: \"Is this sequence number in the first 4 GB or the second?\" And the timestamp is used to break the tie.\nAlso, the Eifel detection algorithm uses TCP timestamps to determine if retransmissions are occurring because packets are lost or simply out of order.[67]\nTCP timestamps are enabled by default in Linux,[68] and disabled by default in Windows Server 2008, 2012 and 2016.[69]\nRecent Statistics show that the level of TCP timestamp adoption has stagnated, at ~40%, owing to Windows Server dropping support since Windows Server 2008.[70]\nOut-of-band data\n[edit]It is possible to interrupt or abort the queued stream instead of waiting for the stream to finish. This is done by specifying the data as urgent. This marks the transmission as out-of-band data (OOB) and tells the receiving program to process it immediately. When finished, TCP informs the application and resumes the stream queue. An example is when TCP is used for a remote login session where the user can send a keyboard sequence that interrupts or aborts the remotely running program without waiting for the program to finish its current transfer.[15]\nThe urgent pointer only alters the processing on the remote host and doesn't expedite any processing on the network itself. The capability is implemented differently or poorly on different systems or may not be supported. Where it is available, it is prudent to assume only single bytes of OOB data will be reliably handled.[71][72] Since the feature is not frequently used, it is not well tested on some platforms and has been associated with vulnerabilities, WinNuke for instance.\nForcing data delivery\n[edit]Normally, TCP waits for 200 ms for a full packet of data to send (Nagle's Algorithm tries to group small messages into a single packet). This wait creates small, but potentially serious delays if repeated constantly during a file transfer. For example, a typical send block would be 4 KB, a typical MSS is 1460, so 2 packets go out on a 10 Mbit/s Ethernet taking ~1.2 ms each followed by a third carrying the remaining 1176 after a 197 ms pause because TCP is waiting for a full buffer. In the case of telnet, each user keystroke is echoed back by the server before the user can see it on the screen. This delay would become very annoying.\nSetting the socket option TCP_NODELAY\noverrides the default 200 ms send delay. Application programs use this socket option to force output to be sent after writing a character or line of characters.\nThe RFC 793 defines the PSH\npush bit as \"a message to the receiving TCP stack to send this data immediately up to the receiving application\".[15] There is no way to indicate or control it in user space using Berkeley sockets; it is controlled by the protocol stack only.[73]\nVulnerabilities\n[edit]TCP may be attacked in a variety of ways. The results of a thorough security assessment of TCP, along with possible mitigations for the identified issues, were published in 2009,[74] and was pursued within the IETF through 2012.[75] Notable vulnerabilities include denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto and TCP reset attack.\nDenial of service\n[edit]By using a spoofed IP address and repeatedly sending purposely assembled SYN packets, followed by many ACK packets, attackers can cause the server to consume large amounts of resources keeping track of the bogus connections. This is known as a SYN flood attack. Proposed solutions to this problem include SYN cookies and cryptographic puzzles, though SYN cookies come with their own set of vulnerabilities.[76] Sockstress is a similar attack, that might be mitigated with system resource management.[77] An advanced DoS attack involving the exploitation of the TCP persist timer was analyzed in Phrack No. 66.[78] PUSH and ACK floods are other variants.[79]\nConnection hijacking\n[edit]An attacker who is able to eavesdrop on a TCP session and redirect packets can hijack a TCP connection. To do so, the attacker learns the sequence number from the ongoing communication and forges a false segment that looks like the next segment in the stream. A simple hijack can result in one packet being erroneously accepted at one end. When the receiving host acknowledges the false segment, synchronization is lost.[80] Hijacking may be combined with ARP spoofing or other routing attacks that allow an attacker to take permanent control of the TCP connection.\nImpersonating a different IP address was not difficult prior to RFC 1948 when the initial sequence number was easily guessable. The earlier implementations allowed an attacker to blindly send a sequence of packets that the receiver would believe came from a different IP address, without the need to intercept communication through ARP or routing attacks: it is enough to ensure that the legitimate host of the impersonated IP address is down, or bring it to that condition using denial-of-service attacks. This is why the initial sequence number is now chosen at random.\nTCP veto\n[edit]An attacker who can eavesdrop and predict the size of the next packet to be sent can cause the receiver to accept a malicious payload without disrupting the existing connection. The attacker injects a malicious packet with the sequence number and a payload size of the next expected packet. When the legitimate packet is ultimately received, it is found to have the same sequence number and length as a packet already received and is silently dropped as a normal duplicate packet—the legitimate packet is vetoed by the malicious packet. Unlike in connection hijacking, the connection is never desynchronized and communication continues as normal after the malicious payload is accepted. TCP veto gives the attacker less control over the communication but makes the attack particularly resistant to detection. The only evidence to the receiver that something is amiss is a single duplicate packet, a normal occurrence in an IP network. The sender of the vetoed packet never sees any evidence of an attack.[81]\nTCP ports\n[edit]A TCP connection is identified by a four-tuple of the source address, source port, destination address, and destination port.[d][82][83] Port numbers are used to identify different services, and to allow multiple connections between hosts.[16] TCP uses 16-bit port numbers, providing 65,536 possible values for each of the source and destination ports.[19] The dependency of connection identity on addresses means that TCP connections are bound to a single network path; TCP cannot use other routes that multihomed hosts have available, and connections break if an endpoint's address changes.[84]\nPort numbers are categorized into three basic categories: well-known, registered, and dynamic or private. The well-known ports are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and are typically used by system-level processes. Well-known applications running as servers and passively listening for connections typically use these ports. Some examples include: FTP (20 and 21), SSH (22), TELNET (23), SMTP (25), HTTP over SSL/TLS (443), and HTTP (80).[e] Registered ports are typically used by end-user applications as ephemeral source ports when contacting servers, but they can also identify named services that have been registered by a third party. Dynamic or private ports can also be used by end-user applications, however, these ports typically do not contain any meaning outside a particular TCP connection.\nNetwork Address Translation (NAT), typically uses dynamic port numbers, on the public-facing side, to disambiguate the flow of traffic that is passing between a public network and a private subnetwork, thereby allowing many IP addresses (and their ports) on the subnet to be serviced by a single public-facing address.\nDevelopment\n[edit]TCP is a complex protocol. However, while significant enhancements have been made and proposed over the years, its most basic operation has not changed significantly since its first specification RFC 675 in 1974, and the v4 specification RFC 793, published in September 1981. RFC 1122, published in October 1989, clarified a number of TCP protocol implementation requirements. A list of the 8 required specifications and over 20 strongly encouraged enhancements is available in RFC 7414. Among this list is RFC 2581, TCP Congestion Control, one of the most important TCP-related RFCs in recent years, describes updated algorithms that avoid undue congestion. In 2001, RFC 3168 was written to describe Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), a congestion avoidance signaling mechanism.\nThe original TCP congestion avoidance algorithm was known as TCP Tahoe, but many alternative algorithms have since been proposed (including TCP Reno, TCP Vegas, FAST TCP, TCP New Reno, and TCP Hybla).\nMultipath TCP (MPTCP)[85][86] is an ongoing effort within the IETF that aims at allowing a TCP connection to use multiple paths to maximize resource usage and increase redundancy. The redundancy offered by Multipath TCP in the context of wireless networks enables the simultaneous use of different networks, which brings higher throughput and better handover capabilities. Multipath TCP also brings performance benefits in datacenter environments.[87] The reference implementation[88] of Multipath TCP was developed in the Linux kernel.[89] Multipath TCP is used to support the Siri voice recognition application on iPhones, iPads and Macs.[90]\ntcpcrypt is an extension proposed in July 2010 to provide transport-level encryption directly in TCP itself. It is designed to work transparently and not require any configuration. Unlike TLS (SSL), tcpcrypt itself does not provide authentication, but provides simple primitives down to the application to do that. The tcpcrypt RFC was published by the IETF in May 2019.[91]\nTCP Fast Open is an extension to speed up the opening of successive TCP connections between two endpoints. It works by skipping the three-way handshake using a cryptographic cookie. It is similar to an earlier proposal called T/TCP, which was not widely adopted due to security issues.[92] TCP Fast Open was published as RFC 7413 in 2014.[93]\nProposed in May 2013, Proportional Rate Reduction (PRR) is a TCP extension developed by Google engineers. PRR ensures that the TCP window size after recovery is as close to the slow start threshold as possible.[94] The algorithm is designed to improve the speed of recovery and is the default congestion control algorithm in Linux 3.2+ kernels.[95]\nDeprecated proposals\n[edit]TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) is an extension proposed in December 2009[96] to secure servers against denial-of-service attacks. Unlike SYN cookies, TCPCT does not conflict with other TCP extensions such as window scaling. TCPCT was designed due to necessities of DNSSEC, where servers have to handle large numbers of short-lived TCP connections. In 2016, TCPCT was deprecated in favor of TCP Fast Open. The status of the original RFC was changed to historic.[97]\nHardware implementations\n[edit]One way to overcome the processing power requirements of TCP is to build hardware implementations of it, widely known as TCP offload engines (TOE). The main problem of TOEs is that they are hard to integrate into computing systems, requiring extensive changes in the operating system of the computer or device.\nTCP low power (TCPlp) has been demonstrated to work in resource constrained environments where otherwise UDP-based CoAP is preferred.[98][99]\nWire image and ossification\n[edit]The wire data of TCP provides significant information-gathering and modification opportunities to on-path observers, as the protocol metadata is transmitted in cleartext.[100][101] While this transparency is useful to network operators[102] and researchers,[103] information gathered from protocol metadata may reduce the end-user's privacy.[104] This visibility and malleability of metadata has led to TCP being difficult to extend—a case of protocol ossification—as any intermediate node (a 'middlebox') can make decisions based on that metadata or even modify it,[105][106] breaking the end-to-end principle.[107] One measurement found that a third of paths across the Internet encounter at least one intermediary that modifies TCP metadata, and 6.5% of paths encounter harmful ossifying effects from intermediaries.[108] Avoiding extensibility hazards from intermediaries placed significant constraints on the design of MPTCP,[109][110] and difficulties caused by intermediaries have hindered the deployment of TCP Fast Open in web browsers.[111] Another source of ossification is the difficulty of modification of TCP functions at the endpoints, typically in the operating system kernel[112] or in hardware with a TCP offload engine.[113]\nPerformance\n[edit]As TCP provides applications with the abstraction of a reliable byte stream, it can suffer from head-of-line blocking: if packets are reordered or lost and need to be retransmitted (and thus are reordered), data from sequentially later parts of the stream may be received before sequentially earlier parts of the stream; however, the later data cannot typically be used until the earlier data has been received, incurring network latency. If multiple independent higher-level messages are encapsulated and multiplexed onto a single TCP connection, then head-of-line blocking can cause processing of a fully-received message that was sent later to wait for delivery of a message that was sent earlier.[114] Web browsers attempt to mitigate head-of-line blocking by opening multiple parallel connections. This incurs the cost of connection establishment repeatedly, as well as multiplying the resources needed to track those connections at the endpoints.[115] Parallel connections also have congestion control operating independently of each other, rather than being able to pool information together and respond more promptly to observed network conditions;[116] TCP's aggressive initial sending patterns can cause congestion if multiple parallel connections are opened; and the per-connection fairness model leads to a monopolization of resources by applications that take this approach.[117]\nConnection establishment is a major contributor to latency as experienced by web users.[118][119] TCP's three-way handshake introduces one RTT of latency during connection establishment before data can be sent.[119] For short flows, these delays are very significant.[120] Transport Layer Security (TLS) requires a handshake of its own for key exchange at connection establishment. Because of the layered design, the TCP handshake and the TLS handshake proceed serially; the TLS handshake cannot begin until the TCP handshake has concluded.[121] Two RTTs are required for connection establishment with TLS 1.2 over TCP.[122] TLS 1.3 allows for zero RTT connection resumption in some circumstances, but, when layered over TCP, one RTT is still required for the TCP handshake, and this cannot assist the initial connection; zero RTT handshakes also present cryptographic challenges, as efficient, replay-safe and forward secure non-interactive key exchange is an open research topic.[123] TCP Fast Open allows the transmission of data in the initial (i.e., SYN and SYN-ACK) packets, removing one RTT of latency during connection establishment.[124] However, TCP Fast Open has been difficult to deploy due to protocol ossification; as of 2020[update], no Web browsers used it by default.[111]\nTCP throughput is affected by packet reordering. Reordered packets can cause duplicate acknowledgments to be sent, which, if they cross a threshold, will then trigger a spurious retransmission and congestion control. Transmission behavior can also become bursty, as large ranges are acknowledged all at once when a reordered packet at the range's start is received (in a manner similar to how head-of-line blocking affects applications).[125] Blanton & Allman (2002) found that throughput was inversely related to the amount of reordering, up to a threshold where all reordering triggers spurious retransmission.[126] Mitigating reordering depends on a sender's ability to determine that it has sent a spurious retransmission, and hence on resolving retransmission ambiguity.[127] Reducing reordering-induced spurious retransmissions may slow recovery from genuine loss.[128]\nSelective acknowledgment can provide a significant benefit to throughput; Bruyeron, Hemon & Zhang (1998) measured gains of up to 45%.[129] An important factor in the improvement is that selective acknowledgment can more often avoid going into slow start after a loss and can hence better use available bandwidth.[130] However, TCP can only selectively acknowledge a maximum of three blocks of sequence numbers. This can limit the retransmission rate and hence loss recovery or cause needless retransmissions, especially in high-loss environments.[131][132]\nTCP was originally designed for wired networks where packet loss is considered to be the result of network congestion and the congestion window size is reduced dramatically as a precaution. However, wireless links are known to experience sporadic and usually temporary losses due to fading, shadowing, hand off, interference, and other radio effects, that are not strictly congestion. After the (erroneous) back-off of the congestion window size, due to wireless packet loss, there may be a congestion avoidance phase with a conservative decrease in window size. This causes the radio link to be underused. Extensive research on combating these harmful effects has been conducted. Suggested solutions can be categorized as end-to-end solutions, which require modifications at the client or server,[133] link layer solutions, such as Radio Link Protocol in cellular networks, or proxy-based solutions which require some changes in the network without modifying end nodes.[133][134] A number of alternative congestion control algorithms, such as Vegas, Westwood, Veno, and Santa Cruz, have been proposed to help solve the wireless problem.[citation needed]\nAcceleration\n[edit]The idea of a TCP accelerator is to terminate TCP connections inside the network processor and then relay the data to a second connection toward the end system. The data packets that originate from the sender are buffered at the accelerator node, which is responsible for performing local retransmissions in the event of packet loss. Thus, in case of losses, the feedback loop between the sender and the receiver is shortened to the one between the acceleration node and the receiver which guarantees a faster delivery of data to the receiver.[135]\nSince TCP is a rate-adaptive protocol, the rate at which the TCP sender injects packets into the network is directly proportional to the prevailing load condition within the network as well as the processing capacity of the receiver. The prevalent conditions within the network are judged by the sender on the basis of the acknowledgments received by it. The acceleration node splits the feedback loop between the sender and the receiver and thus guarantees a shorter round trip time (RTT) per packet. A shorter RTT is beneficial as it ensures a quicker response time to any changes in the network and a faster adaptation by the sender to combat these changes.\nDisadvantages of the method include the fact that the TCP session has to be directed through the accelerator; this means that if routing changes so that the accelerator is no longer in the path, the connection will be broken. It also destroys the end-to-end property of the TCP ACK mechanism; when the ACK is received by the sender, the packet has been stored by the accelerator, not delivered to the receiver.\nDebugging\n[edit]A packet sniffer, which taps TCP traffic on a network link, can be useful in debugging networks, network stacks, and applications that use TCP by showing an engineer what packets are passing through a link. Some networking stacks support the SO_DEBUG socket option, which can be enabled on the socket using setsockopt. That option dumps all the packets, TCP states, and events on that socket, which is helpful in debugging. Netstat is another utility that can be used for debugging.\nAlternatives\n[edit]For many applications TCP is not appropriate. The application cannot normally access the packets coming after a lost packet until the retransmitted copy of the lost packet is received. This causes problems for real-time applications such as streaming media, real-time multiplayer games and voice over IP (VoIP) where it is generally more useful to get most of the data in a timely fashion than it is to get all of the data in order.\nFor historical and performance reasons, most storage area networks (SANs) use Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) over Fibre Channel connections. For embedded systems, network booting, and servers that serve simple requests from huge numbers of clients (e.g. DNS servers) the complexity of TCP can be a problem. Tricks such as transmitting data between two hosts that are both behind NAT (using STUN or similar systems) are far simpler without a relatively complex protocol like TCP in the way.\nGenerally, where TCP is unsuitable, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used. This provides the same application multiplexing and checksums that TCP does, but does not handle streams or retransmission, giving the application developer the ability to code them in a way suitable for the situation, or to replace them with other methods such as forward error correction or error concealment.\nStream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is another protocol that provides reliable stream-oriented services similar to TCP. It is newer and considerably more complex than TCP, and has not yet seen widespread deployment. However, it is especially designed to be used in situations where reliability and near-real-time considerations are important.\nVenturi Transport Protocol (VTP) is a patented proprietary protocol that is designed to replace TCP transparently to overcome perceived inefficiencies related to wireless data transport.\nThe TCP congestion avoidance algorithm works very well for ad-hoc environments where the data sender is not known in advance. If the environment is predictable, a timing-based protocol such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) can avoid TCP's retransmission overhead.\nUDP-based Data Transfer Protocol (UDT) has better efficiency and fairness than TCP in networks that have high bandwidth-delay product.[136]\nMultipurpose Transaction Protocol (MTP/IP) is patented proprietary software that is designed to adaptively achieve high throughput and transaction performance in a wide variety of network conditions, particularly those where TCP is perceived to be inefficient.\nChecksum computation\n[edit]TCP checksum for IPv4\n[edit]When TCP runs over IPv4, the method used to compute the checksum is defined as follows:[18]\nThe checksum field is the 16-bit ones' complement of the ones' complement sum of all 16-bit words in the header and text. The checksum computation needs to ensure the 16-bit alignment of the data being summed. If a segment contains an odd number of header and text octets, alignment can be achieved by padding the last octet with zeros on its right to form a 16-bit word for checksum purposes. The pad is not transmitted as part of the segment. While computing the checksum, the checksum field itself is replaced with zeros.\nIn other words, after appropriate padding, all 16-bit words are added using ones' complement arithmetic. The sum is then bitwise complemented and inserted as the checksum field. A pseudo-header that mimics the IPv4 packet header used in the checksum computation is as follows:\n| Offset | Octet | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Octet | Bit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n| 0 | 0 | Source address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 4 | 32 | Destination address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 8 | 64 | Zeroes | Protocol (6) | TCP length | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 12 | 96 | Source port | Destination port | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 16 | 128 | Sequence number | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 20 | 160 | Acknowledgement number | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 24 | 192 | Data offset | Reserved | Flags | Window | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 28 | 224 | Checksum | Urgent pointer | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 32 | 256 | (Options) | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 36 | 288 | Data | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 40 | 320 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| ⋮ | ⋮ |\nThe checksum is computed over the following fields:\n- Source address: 32 bits\n- The source address in the IPv4 header\n- Destination address: 32 bits\n- The destination address in the IPv4 header\n- Zeroes: 8 bits\n- All zeroes\n- Protocol: 8 bits\n- The protocol value for TCP: 6\n- TCP length: 16 bits\n- The length of the TCP header and data (measured in octets). For example, let's say we have IPv4 packet with Total Length of 200 bytes and IHL value of 5, which indicates a length of 5 bits × 32 bits = 160 bits = 20 bytes. We can compute the TCP length as (Total Length) − (IPv4 Header Length) i.e. 200 − 20, which results in 180 bytes.\nTCP checksum for IPv6\n[edit]When TCP runs over IPv6, the method used to compute the checksum is changed:[137]\nAny transport or other upper-layer protocol that includes the addresses from the IP header in its checksum computation must be modified for use over IPv6, to include the 128-bit IPv6 addresses instead of 32-bit IPv4 addresses.\nA pseudo-header that mimics the IPv6 header for computation of the checksum is shown below.\n| Offset | Octet | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Octet | Bit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n| 0 | 0 | Source address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 4 | 32 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 8 | 64 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 12 | 96 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 16 | 128 | Destination address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 20 | 160 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 24 | 192 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 28 | 224 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 32 | 256 | TCP length | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 36 | 288 | Zeroes | Next header (6) | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 40 | 320 | Source port | Destination port | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 44 | 352 | Sequence number | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 48 | 384 | Acknowledgement number | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 52 | 416 | Data offset | Reserved | Flags | Window | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 56 | 448 | Checksum | Urgent pointer | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 60 | 480 | (Options) | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 64 | 512 | Data | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 68 | 544 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| ⋮ | ⋮ |\nThe checksum is computed over the following fields:\n- Source address: 128 bits\n- The address in the IPv6 header.\n- Destination address: 128 bits\n- The final destination; if the IPv6 packet doesn't contain a Routing header, TCP uses the destination address in the IPv6 header, otherwise, at the originating node, it uses the address in the last element of the Routing header, and, at the receiving node, it uses the destination address in the IPv6 header.\n- TCP length: 32 bits\n- The length of the TCP header and data (measured in octets).\n- Zeroes: 24 bits;\nZeroes == 0\n- All zeroes.\n- Next header: 8 bits\n- The protocol value for TCP: 6.\nChecksum offload\n[edit]Many TCP/IP software stack implementations provide options to use hardware assistance to automatically compute the checksum in the network adapter prior to transmission onto the network or upon reception from the network for validation. This may reduce CPU load associated with calculating the checksum, potentially increasing overall network performance.\nThis feature may cause packet analyzers that are unaware or uncertain about the use of checksum offload to report invalid checksums in outbound packets that have not yet reached the network adapter.[138] This will only occur for packets that are intercepted before being transmitted by the network adapter; all packets transmitted by the network adaptor on the wire will have valid checksums.[139] This issue can also occur when monitoring packets being transmitted between virtual machines on the same host, where a virtual device driver may omit the checksum calculation (as an optimization), knowing that the checksum will be calculated later by the VM host kernel or its physical hardware.\nSee also\n[edit]- Micro-bursting (networking)\n- TCP global synchronization\n- TCP fusion\n- TCP pacing\n- TCP Stealth\n- Transport layer § Comparison of transport layer protocols\n- WTCP a proxy-based modification of TCP for wireless networks\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ a b Added to header by RFC 3168\n- ^ Windows size units are, by default, bytes.\n- ^ Window size is relative to the segment identified by the sequence number in the acknowledgment field.\n- ^ Equivalently, a pair of network sockets for the source and destination, each of which is made up of an address and a port\n- ^ As of the latest standard, HTTP/3, QUIC is used as a transport instead of TCP.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Comer, D.

Archived from the original on 2017-01-31. Retrieved 2017-02-24.\nWireshark captures packets before they are sent to the network adapter. It won't see the correct checksum because it has not been calculated yet. Even worse, most OSes don't bother initialize this data so you're probably seeing little chunks of memory that you shouldn't. New installations of Wireshark 1.2 and above disable IP, TCP, and UDP checksum validation by default. You can disable checksum validation in each of those dissectors by hand if needed.\n- ^ \"Wireshark: Checksums\". Archived from the original on 2016-10-22. Retrieved 2017-02-24.\nChecksum offloading often causes confusion as the network packets to be transmitted are handed over to Wireshark before the checksums are actually calculated. Wireshark gets these \"empty\" checksums and displays them as invalid, even though the packets will contain valid checksums when they leave the network hardware later.\nBibliography\n[edit]Requests for Comments\n[edit]- Cerf, Vint; Dalal, Yogen; Sunshine, Carl (December 1974).

Reed |\n| Introduction | 1980 |\n| Influenced | QUIC, UDP-Lite |\n| OSI layer | Transport layer (4) |\n| IP number | 17 |\n| RFC(s) | 768 |\n| Internet protocol suite |\n|---|\n| Application layer |\n| Transport layer |\n| Internet layer |\n| Link layer |\nIn computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core communication protocols of the Internet protocol suite used to send messages (transported as datagrams in packets) to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.\nUDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that messages are sent without negotiating a connection and that UDP does not keep track of what it has sent.[1][2] UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\nUDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.[3]\nThe protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.\nAttributes\n[edit]UDP is a simple message-oriented transport layer protocol that is documented in RFC 768. Although UDP provides integrity verification (via checksum) of the header and payload,[4] it provides no guarantees to the upper layer protocol for message delivery and the UDP layer retains no state of UDP messages once sent. For this reason, UDP sometimes is referred to as Unreliable Datagram Protocol.[5] If transmission reliability is desired, it must be implemented in the user's application.\nA number of UDP's attributes make it especially suited for certain applications.\n- It is transaction-oriented, suitable for simple query-response protocols such as the Domain Name System or the Network Time Protocol.\n- It provides datagrams, suitable for modeling other protocols such as IP tunneling or remote procedure call and the Network File System.\n- It is simple, suitable for bootstrapping or other purposes without a full protocol stack, such as the DHCP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol.\n- It is stateless, suitable for very large numbers of clients, such as in streaming media applications like IPTV.\n- The lack of retransmission delays makes it suitable for real-time applications such as Voice over IP, online games, and many protocols using Real Time Streaming Protocol.\n- Because it supports multicast, it is suitable for broadcast information, such as in many kinds of service discovery and shared information such as Precision Time Protocol and Routing Information Protocol.\nPorts\n[edit]Applications can use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. An application binds a socket to its endpoint of data transmission, which is a combination of an IP address and a port. In this way, UDP provides application multiplexing. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16-bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65535. Port 0 is reserved, but is a permissible source port value if the sending process does not expect messages in response.\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has divided port numbers into three ranges.[6] Port numbers 0 through 1023 are used for common, well-known services. On Unix-like operating systems, using one of these ports requires superuser operating permission. Port numbers 1024 through 49151 are the registered ports used for IANA-registered services. Ports 49152 through 65535 are dynamic ports that are not officially designated for any specific service and may be used for any purpose. These may also be used as ephemeral ports, which software running on the host may use to dynamically create communications endpoints as needed.[6]\nUDP datagram structure\n[edit]A UDP datagram consists of a datagram header followed by a data section (the payload data for the application). The UDP datagram header consists of 4 fields, each of which is 2 bytes (16 bits):[3]\n| Offset | Octet | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Octet | Bit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n| 0 | 0 | Source Port | Destination Port | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 4 | 32 | Length | Checksum | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 8 | 64 | Data | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 12 | 96 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| ⋮ | ⋮ |\nThe use of the Checksum and Source Port fields is optional in IPv4 (light purple background in table). In IPv6 only the Source Port field is optional. If not used, these fields should be set to zero.[7]\n- Source Port: 16 bits\n- This field identifies the sender's port, when used, and should be assumed to be the port to reply to if needed. If the source host is the client, the port number is likely to be an ephemeral port. If the source host is the server, the port number is likely to be a well-known port number from 0 to 1023.[6]\n- Destination Port: 16 bits\n- This field identifies the receiver's port and is required. Similar to source port number, if the client is the destination host then the port number will likely be an ephemeral port number and if the destination host is the server then the port number will likely be a well-known port number.[6]\n- Length: 16 bits\n- This field specifies the length in bytes of the UDP datagram (the header fields and Data field) in octets. The minimum length is 8 bytes, the length of the header. The field size sets a theoretical limit of 65,535 bytes (8-byte header + 65,527 bytes of data) for a UDP datagram. However, the actual limit for the data length, which is imposed by the underlying IPv4 protocol, is 65,507 bytes (65,535 bytes − 8-byte UDP header − 20-byte IP header).[8]\n- Using IPv6 jumbograms it is possible to have UDP datagrams of size greater than 65,535 bytes. The length field is set to zero if the length of the UDP header plus UDP data is greater than 65,535.[9]\n- Checksum: 16 bits\n- The checksum field may be used for error-checking of the header and data. This field is optional in IPv4, and mandatory in most cases in IPv6.[10]\n- Data: Variable\n- The payload of the UDP packet.\nChecksum computation\n[edit]The method used to compute the checksum is defined in RFC 768, and efficient calculation is discussed in RFC 1071:\nChecksum is the 16-bit ones' complement of the ones' complement sum of a pseudo header of information from the IP header, the UDP header, and the data, padded with zero octets at the end (if necessary) to make a multiple of two octets.[7]\nIn other words, all 16-bit words are summed using ones' complement arithmetic. Add the 16-bit values up. On each addition, if a carry-out (17th bit) is produced, swing that 17th carry bit around and add it to the least significant bit of the running total.[11] Finally, the sum is then ones' complemented to yield the value of the UDP checksum field.\nIf the checksum calculation results in the value zero (all 16 bits 0) it should be sent as the ones' complement (all 1s) as a zero-value checksum indicates no checksum has been calculated.[7] In this case, any specific processing is not required at the receiver, because all 0s and all 1s are equal to zero in 1's complement arithmetic.\nThe differences between IPv4 and IPv6 are in the pseudo header used to compute the checksum, and that the checksum is not optional in IPv6.[12] Under specific conditions, a UDP application using IPv6 is allowed to use a zero UDP zero-checksum mode with a tunnel protocol.[13]\nIPv4 pseudo header\n[edit]When UDP runs over IPv4, the checksum is computed using a pseudo header that contains some of the same information from the real IPv4 header.[7]: 2 The pseudo header is not the real IPv4 header used to send an IP packet, it is used only for the checksum calculation. UDP checksum computation is optional for IPv4. If a checksum is not used it should be set to the value zero.\n| Offset | Octet | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Octet | Bit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n| 0 | 0 | Source Address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 4 | 32 | Destination Address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 8 | 64 | Zeroes | Protocol | UDP Length | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 12 | 96 | Source Port | Destination Port | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 16 | 128 | Length | Checksum | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 20 | 160 | Data | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 24 | 192 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| ⋮ | ⋮ |\nThe checksum is calculated over the following fields:\n- Source Address: 32 bits\n- The source address from the IPv4 header.\n- Destination Address: 32 bits\n- The destination address from the IPv4 header.\n- Zeroes: 8 bits; Zeroes == 0\n- All zeroes.\n- Protocol: 8 bits\n- The protocol value for UDP: 17 (or 0x11).\n- UDP length: 16 bits\n- The length of the UDP header and data (measured in octets).\nIPv6 pseudo header\n[edit]As IPv6 has larger addresses and a different header layout, the method used to compute the checksum is changed accordingly:[10]: §8.1\nAny transport or other upper-layer protocol that includes the addresses from the IP header in its checksum computation must be modified for use over IPv6, to include the 128-bit IPv6 addresses instead of 32-bit IPv4 addresses.\nWhen computing the checksum, again a pseudo header is used that mimics the real IPv6 header:\n| Offset | Octet | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Octet | Bit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n| 0 | 0 | Source address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 4 | 32 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 8 | 64 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 12 | 96 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 16 | 128 | Destination address | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 20 | 160 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 24 | 192 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 28 | 224 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 32 | 256 | UDP length | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 36 | 288 | Zeroes (0) | Next Header (17) | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 40 | 320 | Source port | Destination port | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 44 | 352 | Length | Checksum | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 48 | 384 | Data | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 52 | 416 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| ⋮ | ⋮ |\nThe checksum is computed over the following fields:\n- Source address: 128 bits\n- The address in the IPv6 header.\n- Destination address: 128 bits\n- The final destination; if the IPv6 packet does not contain a Routing header, TCP uses the destination address in the IPv6 header, otherwise, at the originating node, it uses the address in the last element of the Routing header, and, at the receiving node, it uses the destination address in the IPv6 header.\n- UDP length: 32 bits\n- The length of the UDP header and data (measured in octets).\n- Zeroes: 24 bits; Zeroes == 0\n- All zeroes.\n- Next Header: 8 bits\n- The transport layer protocol value for UDP: 17.\nReliability and congestion control\n[edit]Lacking reliability, UDP applications may encounter some packet loss, reordering, errors or duplication. If using UDP, the end-user applications must provide any necessary handshaking such as real-time confirmation that the message has been received. Applications, such as TFTP, may add rudimentary reliability mechanisms into the application layer as needed.[6] If an application requires a high degree of reliability, a protocol such as the Transmission Control Protocol may be used instead.\nMost often, UDP applications do not employ reliability mechanisms and may even be hindered by them. Streaming media, real-time multiplayer games and voice over IP (VoIP) are examples of applications that often use UDP. In these particular applications, loss of packets is not usually a fatal problem. In VoIP, for example, latency and jitter are the primary concerns. The use of TCP would cause jitter if any packets were lost as TCP does not provide subsequent data to the application while it is requesting a re-send of the missing data.\nApplications\n[edit]Numerous key Internet applications use UDP, including: the Domain Name System (DNS), the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the Routing Information Protocol (RIP)[3] and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\nVoice and video traffic is generally transmitted using UDP. Real-time video and audio streaming protocols are designed to handle occasional lost packets, so only slight degradation in quality occurs, rather than large delays if lost packets were retransmitted. Because both TCP and UDP run over the same network, in the mid-2000s a few businesses found that an increase in UDP traffic from these real-time applications slightly hindered the performance of applications using TCP such as point of sale, accounting, and database systems (when TCP detects packet loss, it will throttle back its data rate usage).[14]\nSome VPN systems such as OpenVPN may use UDP and perform error checking at the application level while implementing reliable connections. WireGuard uses UDP and performs error checking, but does not provide any reliability guarantees, leaving it for the encapsulated protocols to deal with.\nQUIC is a transport protocol built on top of UDP. QUIC provides a reliable and secure connection. HTTP/3 uses QUIC as opposed to earlier versions of HTTPS which use a combination of TCP and TLS to ensure reliability and security respectively. This means that HTTP/3 uses a single handshake to set up a connection, rather than having two separate handshakes for TCP and TLS, meaning the overall time to establish a connection is reduced.[15]\nComparison of UDP and TCP\n[edit]Transmission Control Protocol is a connection-oriented protocol and requires handshaking to set up end-to-end communications. Once a connection is set up, user data may be sent bi-directionally over the connection.\n- Reliable – TCP manages message acknowledgment, retransmission and timeouts. Multiple attempts to deliver the message are made. If data gets lost along the way, data will be re-sent. In TCP, there's either no missing data or, in case of multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped.\n- Ordered – If two messages are sent over a connection in sequence, the first message will reach the receiving application first. When data segments arrive in the wrong order, TCP buffers the out-of-order data until all data can be properly re-ordered and delivered to the application.\n- Heavyweight – TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control.\n- Streaming – Data is read as a byte stream; no distinguishing indications are transmitted to signal message (segment) boundaries.\nUser Datagram Protocol is a simpler message-based connectionless protocol. Connectionless protocols do not set up a dedicated end-to-end connection. Communication is achieved by transmitting information in one direction from source to destination without verifying the readiness or state of the receiver.\n- Unreliable – When a UDP message is sent, it cannot be known if it will reach its destination; it could get lost along the way. There is no concept of acknowledgment, retransmission, or timeout.\n- Not ordered – If two messages are sent to the same recipient, the order in which they arrive cannot be guaranteed.\n- Lightweight – There is no ordering of messages, no tracking connections, etc. It is a very simple transport layer designed on top of IP.\n- Datagrams – Packets are sent individually and are checked for integrity on arrival. Packets have definite boundaries, which are honored upon receipt; a read operation at the receiver socket will yield an entire message as it was originally sent.\n- No congestion control – UDP itself does not avoid congestion. Congestion control measures must be implemented at the application level or in the network.\n- Broadcasts – being connectionless, UDP can broadcast - sent packets can be addressed to be receivable by all devices on the subnet.\n- Multicast – a multicast mode of operation is supported whereby a single datagram packet can be automatically routed without duplication to a group of subscribers.\nStandards\n[edit]- RFC 768 – User Datagram Protocol\n- RFC 2460 – Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification\n- RFC 2675 – IPv6 Jumbograms\n- RFC 4113 – Management Information Base for the UDP\n- RFC 8085 – UDP Usage Guidelines\nSee also\n[edit]- Comparison of transport layer protocols\n- Constrained Application Protocol\n- Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\n- List of TCP and UDP port numbers\n- Micro Transport Protocol (μTP)\n- Reliable Data Protocol (RDP)\n- Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP)\n- UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol\n- UDP flood attack\n- UDP Helper Address\n- UDP hole punching\n- UDP-Lite – a variant that delivers packets even if they are malformed\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Castelli, Matthew J.

It associates various information with domain names (identification strings) assigned to each of the associated entities. Most prominently, it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.[1] The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.\nThe Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over subdomains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database. In addition, the DNS specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet protocol suite.\nThe Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the IP address spaces.[2] The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.\nThe most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for start of authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general-purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general-purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing blocklists. The DNS database is conventionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file, but other database systems are common.\nThe Domain Name System originally used the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as transport over IP. Reliability, security, and privacy concerns spawned the use of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as well as numerous other protocol developments.\nFunction\n[edit]An often-used analogy to explain the DNS is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the hostname www.example.com\nwithin the domain name example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.34 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 (IPv6). The DNS can be quickly and transparently updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same hostname. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.\nAn important and ubiquitous function of the DNS is its central role in distributed Internet services such as cloud services and content delivery networks.[3] When a user accesses a distributed Internet service using a URL, the domain name of the URL is translated to the IP address of a server that is proximal to the user. The key functionality of the DNS exploited here is that different users can simultaneously receive different translations for the same domain name, a key point of divergence from a traditional phone-book view of the DNS. This process of using the DNS to assign proximal servers to users is key to providing faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is widely used by most major Internet services.[4]\nThe DNS reflects the structure of administrative responsibility on the Internet.[5] Each subdomain is a zone of administrative autonomy delegated to a manager. For zones operated by a registry, administrative information is often complemented by the registry's RDAP and WHOIS services. That data can be used to gain insight on, and track responsibility for, a given host on the Internet.[6]\nHistory\n[edit]Using a simpler, more memorable name in place of a host's numerical address dates back to the ARPANET era. The Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) maintained a text file named HOSTS.TXT that mapped host names to the numerical addresses of computers on the ARPANET.[7][8] Elizabeth Feinler developed and maintained the first ARPANET directory.[9][10] Maintenance of numerical addresses, called the Assigned Numbers List, was handled by Jon Postel at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI.[11]\nAddresses were assigned manually. Computers, including their hostnames and addresses, were added to the primary file by contacting the SRI Network Information Center (NIC), directed by Feinler, via telephone during business hours.[12] Later, Feinler set up a WHOIS directory on a server in the NIC for retrieval of information about resources, contacts, and entities.[13] She and her team developed the concept of domains.[13] Feinler suggested that domains should be based on the location of the physical address of the computer.[14] Computers at educational institutions would have the domain edu, for example.[15] She and her team managed the Host Naming Registry from 1972 to 1989.[16]\nBy the early 1980s, maintaining a single, centralized host table had become slow and unwieldy and the emerging network required an automated naming system to address technical and personnel issues. Postel directed the task of forging a compromise between five competing proposals of solutions to Paul Mockapetris. Mockapetris instead created the Domain Name System in 1983 while at the University of Southern California.[12][17]\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force published the original specifications in RFC 882 and RFC 883 in November 1983.[18][19] These were updated in RFC 973 in January 1986.[20]\nIn 1984, four UC Berkeley students, Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle, and Songnian Zhou, wrote the first Unix name server implementation for the Berkeley Internet Name Domain, commonly referred to as BIND.[21] In 1985, Kevin Dunlap of DEC substantially revised the DNS implementation. Mike Karels, Phil Almquist, and Paul Vixie then took over BIND maintenance. Internet Systems Consortium was founded in 1994 by Rick Adams, Paul Vixie, and Carl Malamud, expressly to provide a home for BIND development and maintenance. BIND versions from 4.9.3 onward were developed and maintained by ISC, with support provided by ISC's sponsors. As co-architects/programmers, Bob Halley and Paul Vixie released the first production-ready version of BIND version 8 in May 1997. Since 2000, over 43 different core developers have worked on BIND.[22]\nIn November 1987, RFC 1034[23] and RFC 1035[5] superseded the 1983 DNS specifications. Several additional Request for Comments have proposed extensions to the core DNS protocols.[24]\nStructure\n[edit]Domain name space\n[edit]The domain name space consists of a tree data structure. Each node or leaf in the tree has a label and zero or more resource records (RR), which hold information associated with the domain name. The domain name itself consists of the label, concatenated with the name of its parent node on the right, separated by a dot.[23]: §3.1\nThe tree sub-divides into zones beginning at the root zone. A DNS zone may consist of as many domains and subdomains as the zone manager chooses. DNS can also be partitioned according to class where the separate classes can be thought of as an array of parallel namespace trees.[23]: §4.2\nAdministrative responsibility for any zone may be divided by creating additional zones. Authority over the new zone is said to be delegated to a designated name server. The parent zone ceases to be authoritative for the new zone.[23]: §4.2\nDomain name syntax, internationalization\n[edit]The definitive descriptions of the rules for forming domain names appear in RFC 1035, RFC 1123, RFC 2181, and RFC 5892. A domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called labels, that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com.\nThe right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain com.\nThe hierarchy of domains descends from right to left; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example, the label example specifies a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a subdomain of example.com. This tree of subdivisions may have up to 127 levels.[25]\nA label may contain zero to 63 characters, because the length is only allowed to take 6 bits. The null label of length zero is reserved for the root zone. The full domain name may not exceed the length of 253 characters in its textual representation (or 254 with the trailing dot).[23] In the internal binary representation of the DNS this maximum length of 253 requires 255 octets of storage, as it also stores the length of the first of many labels and adds last null byte.[5] 255 length is only achieved with at least 6 labels (counting the last null label).[5]\nAlthough no technical limitation exists to prevent domain name labels from using any character that is representable by an octet, hostnames use a preferred format and character set. The characters allowed in labels are a subset of the ASCII character set, consisting of characters a through z, A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and hyphen. This rule is known as the LDH rule (letters, digits, hyphen). Domain names are interpreted in a case-independent manner.[26] Labels may not start or end with a hyphen.[27] An additional rule requires that top-level domain names should not be all-numeric.[27]\nThe limited set of ASCII characters permitted in the DNS prevented the representation of names and words of many languages in their native alphabets or scripts. To make this possible, ICANN approved the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) system, by which user applications, such as web browsers, map Unicode strings into the valid DNS character set using Punycode. In 2009, ICANN approved the installation of internationalized domain name country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). In addition, many registries of the existing top-level domain names (TLDs) have adopted the IDNA system, guided by RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893.\nName servers\n[edit]The Domain Name System is maintained by a distributed database system, which uses the client–server model. The nodes of this database are the name servers. Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it. The top of the hierarchy is served by the root name servers, the servers to query when looking up (resolving) a TLD.\nAuthoritative name server\n[edit]An authoritative name server is a name server that only gives answers to DNS queries from data that have been configured by an original source, for example, the domain administrator or by dynamic DNS methods, in contrast to answers obtained via a query to another name server that only maintains a cache of data.\nAn authoritative name server can either be a primary server or a secondary server. Historically the terms master/slave and primary/secondary were sometimes used interchangeably[28] but the current practice is to use the latter form. A primary server is a server that stores the original copies of all zone records. A secondary server uses a special automatic updating mechanism in the DNS protocol in communication with its primary to maintain an identical copy of the primary records.\nEvery DNS zone must be assigned a set of authoritative name servers. This set of servers is stored in the parent domain zone with name server (NS) records.\nAn authoritative server indicates its status of supplying definitive answers, deemed authoritative, by setting a protocol flag, called the \"Authoritative Answer\" (AA) bit in its responses.[5] This flag is usually reproduced prominently in the output of DNS administration query tools, such as dig, to indicate that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in question.[5]\nWhen a name server is designated as the authoritative server for a domain name for which it does not have authoritative data, it presents a type of error called a \"lame delegation\" or \"lame response\".[29][30]\nOperation\n[edit]Address resolution mechanism\n[edit]Domain name resolvers determine the domain name servers responsible for the domain name in question by a sequence of queries starting with the right-most (top-level) domain label.\nFor proper operation of its domain name resolver, a network host is configured with an initial cache (hints) of the known addresses of the root name servers. The hints are updated periodically by an administrator by retrieving a dataset from a reliable source.\nAssuming the resolver has no cached records to accelerate the process, the resolution process starts with a query to one of the root servers. In typical operation, the root servers do not answer directly, but respond with a referral to more authoritative servers, e.g., a query for \"www.wikipedia.org\" is referred to the org servers. The resolver now queries the servers referred to, and iteratively repeats this process until it receives an authoritative answer. The diagram illustrates this process for the host that is named by the fully qualified domain name \"www.wikipedia.org\".\nThis mechanism would place a large traffic burden on the root servers, if every resolution on the Internet required starting at the root. In practice caching is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and as a result, root name servers actually are involved in only a relatively small fraction of all requests.\nRecursive and caching name server\n[edit]In theory, authoritative name servers are sufficient for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the root zone of the Domain Name System and each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.[31]\nTo improve efficiency, reduce DNS traffic across the Internet, and increase performance in end-user applications, the Domain Name System supports DNS cache servers which store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (time-to-live) of the domain name record in question. Typically, such caching DNS servers also implement the recursive algorithm necessary to resolve a given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With this function implemented in the name server, user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.\nThe combination of DNS caching and recursive functions in a name server is not mandatory; the functions can be implemented independently in servers for special purposes.\nInternet service providers typically provide recursive and caching name servers for their customers. In addition, many home networking routers implement DNS caches and recursion to improve efficiency in the local network.\nDNS resolvers\n[edit]The client side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. A resolver is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation of a domain name into an IP address. DNS resolvers are classified by a variety of query methods, such as recursive, non-recursive, and iterative. A resolution process may use a combination of these methods.[23]\nIn a non-recursive query, a DNS resolver queries a DNS server that provides a record either for which the server is authoritative, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers. In case of a caching DNS resolver, the non-recursive query of its local DNS cache delivers a result and reduces the load on upstream DNS servers by caching DNS resource records for a period of time after an initial response from upstream DNS servers.\nIn a recursive query, a DNS resolver queries a single DNS server, which may in turn query other DNS servers on behalf of the requester. For example, a simple stub resolver running on a home router typically makes a recursive query to the DNS server run by the user's ISP. A recursive query is one for which the DNS server answers the query completely by querying other name servers as needed. In typical operation, a client issues a recursive query to a caching recursive DNS server, which subsequently issues non-recursive queries to determine the answer and send a single answer back to the client. The resolver, or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the resolver, negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query headers. DNS servers are not required to support recursive queries.\nThe iterative query procedure is a process in which a DNS resolver queries a chain of one or more DNS servers. Each server refers the client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global root server, then a \"com\" server, and finally an \"example.com\" server.\nCircular dependencies and glue records\n[edit]Name servers in delegations are identified by name, rather than by IP address. This means that a resolving name server must issue another DNS request to find out the IP address of the server to which it has been referred. If the name given in the delegation is a subdomain of the domain for which the delegation is being provided, there is a circular dependency.\nIn this case, the name server providing the delegation must also provide one or more IP addresses for the authoritative name server mentioned in the delegation. This information is called glue. The delegating name server provides this glue in the form of records in the additional section of the DNS response, and provides the delegation in the authority section of the response. A glue record is a combination of the name server and IP address.\nFor example, if the authoritative name server for example.org is ns1.example.org, a computer trying to resolve www.example.org first resolves ns1.example.org. As ns1 is contained in example.org, this requires resolving example.org first, which presents a circular dependency. To break the dependency, the name server for the top level domain org includes glue along with the delegation for example.org. The glue records are address records that provide IP addresses for ns1.example.org. The resolver uses one or more of these IP addresses to query one of the domain's authoritative servers, which allows it to complete the DNS query.\nRecord caching\n[edit]A common approach to reduce the query load on DNS servers is to cache the results of name resolution locally or on intermediary resolver hosts. Each DNS query result comes with a time to live (TTL), which indicates how long the information remains valid before it needs to be discarded or refreshed. This TTL is determined by the administrator of the authoritative DNS server and can range from a few seconds to several days or even weeks.[32]\nAs a result of this distributed caching architecture, changes to DNS records do not propagate throughout the network immediately, but require all caches to expire and to be refreshed after the TTL. RFC 1912 conveys basic rules for determining appropriate TTL values.\nSome resolvers may override TTL values, as the protocol supports caching for up to sixty-eight years or no caching at all. Negative caching, i.e. the caching of the fact of non-existence of a record, is determined by name servers authoritative for a zone which must include the Start of Authority (SOA) record when reporting no data of the requested type exists. The value of the minimum field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself is used to establish the TTL for the negative answer.\nReverse lookup\n[edit]A reverse DNS lookup is a query of the DNS for domain names when the IP address is known. Multiple domain names may be associated with an IP address. The DNS stores IP addresses in the form of domain names as specially formatted names in pointer (PTR) records within the infrastructure top-level domain arpa. For IPv4, the domain is in-addr.arpa. For IPv6, the reverse lookup domain is ip6.arpa. The IP address is represented as a name in reverse-ordered octet representation for IPv4, and reverse-ordered nibble representation for IPv6.\nWhen performing a reverse lookup, the DNS client converts the address into these formats before querying the name for a PTR record following the delegation chain as for any DNS query. For example, assuming the IPv4 address 208.80.152.2 is assigned to Wikimedia, it is represented as a DNS name in reverse order: 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa. When the DNS resolver gets a pointer (PTR) request, it begins by querying the root servers, which point to the servers of American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) for the 208.in-addr.arpa zone. ARIN's servers delegate 152.80.208.in-addr.arpa to Wikimedia to which the resolver sends another query for 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which results in an authoritative response.\nClient lookup\n[edit]Users generally do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as web browsers, e-mail clients, and other Internet applications. When an application makes a request that requires a domain name lookup, such programs send a resolution request to the DNS resolver in the local operating system, which in turn handles the communications required.\nThe DNS resolver will almost invariably have a cache (see above) containing recent lookups. If the cache can provide the answer to the request, the resolver will return the value in the cache to the program that made the request. If the cache does not contain the answer, the resolver will send the request to one or more designated DNS servers. In the case of most home users, the Internet service provider to which the machine connects will usually supply this DNS server: such a user will either have configured that server's address manually or allowed DHCP to set it; however, where systems administrators have configured systems to use their own DNS servers, their DNS resolvers point to separately maintained name servers of the organization. In any event, the name server thus queried will follow the process outlined above, until it either successfully finds a result or does not. It then returns its results to the DNS resolver; assuming it has found a result, the resolver duly caches that result for future use, and hands the result back to the software which initiated the request.\nBroken resolvers\n[edit]Some large ISPs have configured their DNS servers to violate rules, such as by disobeying TTLs, or by indicating that a domain name does not exist just because one of its name servers does not respond.[33]\nSome applications such as web browsers maintain an internal DNS cache to avoid repeated lookups via the network. This practice can add extra difficulty when debugging DNS issues as it obscures the history of such data. These caches typically use very short caching times on the order of one minute.[34]\nInternet Explorer represents a notable exception: versions up to IE 3.x cache DNS records for 24 hours by default. Internet Explorer 4.x and later versions (up to IE 8) decrease the default timeout value to half an hour, which may be changed by modifying the default configuration.[35]\nWhen Google Chrome detects issues with the DNS server it displays a specific error message.\nOther applications\n[edit]The Domain Name System includes several other functions and features.\nHostnames and IP addresses are not required to match in a one-to-one relationship. Multiple hostnames may correspond to a single IP address, which is useful in virtual hosting, in which many web sites are served from a single host. Alternatively, a single hostname may resolve to many IP addresses to facilitate fault tolerance and load distribution to multiple server instances across an enterprise or the global Internet.\nDNS serves other purposes in addition to translating names to IP addresses. For instance, mail transfer agents use DNS to find the best mail server to deliver e-mail: An MX record provides a mapping between a domain and a mail exchanger; this can provide an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.\nThe DNS is used for efficient storage and distribution of IP addresses of block-listed email hosts. A common method is to place the IP address of the subject host into the sub-domain of a higher level domain name, and to resolve that name to a record that indicates a positive or a negative indication.\nFor example:\n- The address 203.0.113.5 is block-listed. It points to 5.113.0.203.blocklist.example, which resolves to 127.0.0.1.\n- The address 203.0.113.6 is not block-listed and points to 6.113.0.203.blocklist.example. This hostname is either not configured, or resolves to 127.0.0.2.\nE-mail servers can query blocklist.example to find out if a specific host connecting to them is in the block list. Many such block lists, either subscription-based or free of cost, are available for use by email administrators and anti-spam software.\nTo provide resilience in the event of computer or network failure, multiple DNS servers are usually provided for coverage of each domain. At the top level of global DNS, thirteen groups of root name servers exist, with additional \"copies\" of them distributed worldwide via anycast addressing.\nDynamic DNS (DDNS) updates a DNS server with a client IP address on-the-fly, for example, when moving between ISPs or mobile hot spots, or when the IP address changes administratively.\nDNS message format\n[edit]The DNS protocol uses two types of DNS messages, queries and responses; both have the same format. Each message consists of a header and four sections: question, answer, authority, and an additional space. A header field (flags) controls the content of these four sections.[23]\nThe header section consists of the following fields: Identification, Flags, Number of questions, Number of answers, Number of authority resource records (RRs), and Number of additional RRs. Each field is 16 bits long, and appears in the order given. The identification field is used to match responses with queries. After the flags word, the header ends with four 16-bit integers which contain the number of records in each of the sections that follow, in the same order.\n| Offset | Octet | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Octet | Bit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n| 0 | 0 | Transaction ID | QR | OPCODE | AA | TC | RD | RA | Z | AD | CD | RCODE | |||||||||||||||||||||\n| 4 | 32 | Number of Questions | Number of Answers | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| 8 | 64 | Number of Authority RRs | Number of additional RRs |\n- Transaction ID: 16 bits\n- Transaction ID\n- Flags: 16 bits\n- The flag field consists of sub-fields as follows:\n- QR: 1 bit\n- Indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1).\n- OPCODE: 4 bits\n- The type can be QUERY (standard query, 0), IQUERY (inverse query, 1), or STATUS (server status request, 2).\n- AA: 1 bit\n- Authoritative Answer, in a response, indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname.\n- TC: 1 bit\n- TrunCation, indicates that this message was truncated due to excessive length.\n- RD: 1 bit\n- Recursion Desired, indicates if the client means a recursive query.\n- RA: 1 bit\n- Recursion Available, in a response, indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion.\n- Z: 1 bit; (Z) == 0\n- Zero, reserved for future use.\n- AD: 1 bit\n- Authentic Data, in a response, indicates if the replying DNS server verified the data.\n- CD: 1 bit\n- Checking Disabled, in a query, indicates that non-verified data is acceptable in a response.\n- RCODE: 4 bits\n- Response code, can be NOERROR (0), FORMERR (1, Format error), SERVFAIL (2), NXDOMAIN (3, Nonexistent domain), etc.[36]\n- Number of Questions: 16 bits\n- Number of Questions.\n- Number of Answers: 16 bits\n- Number of Answers.\n- Number of Authority RRs: 16 bits\n- Number of Authority Resource Records.\n- Number of Additional RRs: 16 bits\n- Number of Additional Resource Records.\nQuestion section\n[edit]The question section has a simpler format than the resource record format used in the other sections. Each question record (there is usually just one in the section) contains the following fields:\n| Field | Description | Length (octets) |\n|---|---|---|\n| NAME | Name of the requested resource | Variable |\n| TYPE | Type of RR (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) | 2 |\n| CLASS | Class code | 2 |\nThe domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label.[37]\nResource records\n[edit]The Domain Name System specifies a database of information elements for network resources. The types of information elements are categorized and organized with a list of DNS record types, the resource records (RRs). Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a resource record set (RRset), having no special ordering. DNS resolvers return the entire set upon query, but servers may implement round-robin ordering to achieve load balancing. In contrast, the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.\nWhen sent over an Internet Protocol network, all records (answer, authority, and additional sections) use the common format specified in RFC 1035:[38]: §3\n| Field | Description | Length (octets) |\n|---|---|---|\n| NAME | Name of the node to which this record pertains | Variable |\n| TYPE | Type of RR in numeric form (e.g., 15 for MX RRs) | 2 |\n| CLASS | Class code | 2 |\n| TTL | Count of seconds that the RR stays valid (The maximum is 231−1, which is about 68 years) | 4 |\n| RDLENGTH | Length of RDATA field (specified in octets) | 2 |\n| RDATA | Additional RR-specific data | Variable, as per RDLENGTH |\nNAME is the fully qualified domain name of the node in the tree.[clarification needed] On the wire, the name may be shortened using label compression where ends of domain names mentioned earlier in the packet can be substituted for the end of the current domain name.\nTYPE is the record type. It indicates the format of the data and it gives a hint of its intended use. For example, the A record is used to translate from a domain name to an IPv4 address, the NS record lists which name servers can answer lookups on a DNS zone, and the MX record specifies the mail server used to handle mail for a domain specified in an e-mail address.\nRDATA is data of type-specific relevance, such as the IP address for address records, or the priority and hostname for MX records. Well known record types may use label compression in the RDATA field, but \"unknown\" record types must not (RFC 3597).\nThe CLASS of a record is set to IN (for Internet) for common DNS records involving Internet hostnames, servers, or IP addresses. In addition, the classes Chaos (CH) and Hesiod (HS) exist.[38]: 11 Each class is an independent name space with potentially different delegations of DNS zones.\nIn addition to resource records defined in a zone file, the domain name system also defines several request types that are used only in communication with other DNS nodes (on the wire), such as when performing zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR) or for EDNS (OPT).\nWildcard records\n[edit]The domain name system supports wildcard DNS records which specify names that start with the asterisk label, *\n, e.g., *.example\n.[23][39] DNS records belonging to wildcard domain names specify rules for generating resource records within a single DNS zone by substituting whole labels with matching components of the query name, including any specified descendants. For example, in the following configuration, the DNS zone x.example specifies that all subdomains, including subdomains of subdomains, of x.example use the mail exchanger (MX) a.x.example. The AAAA record for a.x.example is needed to specify the mail exchanger IP address. As this has the result of excluding this domain name and its subdomains from the wildcard matches, an additional MX record for the subdomain a.x.example, as well as a wildcarded MX record for all of its subdomains, must also be defined in the DNS zone.\nx.example. MX 10 a.x.example.\n*.x.example. MX 10 a.x.example.\na.x.example. MX 10 a.x.example.\n*.a.x.example. MX 10 a.x.example.\na.x.example. AAAA 2001:db8::1\nThe role of wildcard records was refined in RFC 4592, because the original definition in RFC 1034 was incomplete and resulted in misinterpretations by implementers.[39]\nProtocol extensions\n[edit]The original DNS protocol had limited provisions for extension with new features. In 1999, Paul Vixie published in RFC 2671 (superseded by RFC 6891) an extension mechanism, called Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS) that introduced optional protocol elements without increasing overhead when not in use. This was accomplished through the OPT pseudo-resource record that only exists in wire transmissions of the protocol, but not in any zone files. Initial extensions were also suggested (EDNS0), such as increasing the DNS message size in UDP datagrams.\nDynamic zone updates\n[edit]Dynamic DNS updates use the UPDATE DNS opcode to add or remove resource records dynamically from a zone database maintained on an authoritative DNS server.[40] This facility is useful to register network clients into the DNS when they boot or become otherwise available on the network. As a booting client may be assigned a different IP address each time from a DHCP server, it is not possible to provide static DNS assignments for such clients.\nTransport protocols\n[edit]From the time of its origin in 1983 the DNS has used the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for transport over IP. Its limitations have motivated numerous protocol developments for reliability, security, privacy, and other criteria, in the following decades.\nConventional: DNS over UDP and TCP port 53 (Do53)\n[edit]UDP reserves port number 53 for servers listening to queries.[5] Such a query consists of a clear-text request sent in a single UDP packet from the client, responded to with a clear-text reply sent in a single UDP packet from the server. When the length of the answer exceeds 512 bytes and both client and server support Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS), larger UDP packets may be used.[41] Use of DNS over UDP is limited by, among other things, its lack of transport-layer encryption, authentication, reliable delivery, and message length. In 1989, RFC 1123 specified optional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transport for DNS queries, replies and, particularly, zone transfers. Via fragmentation of long replies, TCP allows longer responses, reliable delivery, and re-use of long-lived connections between clients and servers. For larger responses, the server refers the client to TCP transport.\nDNS over TLS (DoT)\n[edit]DNS over TLS emerged as an IETF standard for encrypted DNS in 2016, utilizing Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect the entire connection, rather than just the DNS payload. DoT servers listen on TCP port 853. RFC 7858 specifies that opportunistic encryption and authenticated encryption may be supported, but did not make either server or client authentication mandatory.\nDNS over HTTPS (DoH)\n[edit]DNS over HTTPS was developed as a competing standard for DNS query transport in 2018, tunneling DNS query data over HTTPS, which transports HTTP over TLS. DoH was promoted as a more web-friendly alternative to DNS since, like DNSCrypt, it uses TCP port 443, and thus looks similar to web traffic, though they are easily differentiable in practice without proper padding.[42]\nDNS over QUIC (DoQ)\n[edit]RFC 9250, published in 2022 by the Internet Engineering Task Force, describes DNS over QUIC. It has \"privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) [...], and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP\". This method is not the same as DNS over HTTP/3.[43]\nOblivious DoH (ODoH) and predecessor Oblivious DNS (ODNS)\n[edit]Oblivious DNS (ODNS) was invented and implemented by researchers at Princeton University and the University of Chicago as an extension to unencrypted DNS,[44] before DoH was standardized and widely deployed. Apple and Cloudflare subsequently deployed the technology in the context of DoH, as Oblivious DoH (ODoH).[45] ODoH combines ingress/egress separation (invented in ODNS) with DoH's HTTPS tunneling and TLS transport-layer encryption in a single protocol.[46]\nDNS over Tor\n[edit]DNS may be run over virtual private networks (VPNs) and tunneling protocols. The privacy gains of Oblivious DNS can be garnered through the use of the preexisting Tor network of ingress and egress nodes, paired with the transport-layer encryption provided by TLS.[47]\nDNSCrypt\n[edit]The DNSCrypt protocol, which was developed in 2011 outside the IETF standards framework, introduced DNS encryption on the downstream side of recursive resolvers, wherein clients encrypt query payloads using servers' public keys, which are published in the DNS (rather than relying upon third-party certificate authorities) and which may in turn be protected by DNSSEC signatures.[48] DNSCrypt uses either TCP port 443, the same port as HTTPS encrypted web traffic, or UDP port 443. This introduced not only privacy regarding the content of the query, but also a significant measure of firewall-traversal capability. In 2019, DNSCrypt was further extended to support an \"anonymized\" mode, similar to the proposed \"Oblivious DNS\", in which an ingress node receives a query which has been encrypted with the public key of a different server, and relays it to that server, which acts as an egress node, performing the recursive resolution.[49] Privacy of user/query pairs is created, since the ingress node does not know the content of the query, while the egress node does not know the identity of the client. DNSCrypt was first implemented in production by OpenDNS in December 2011. There are several free and open source software implementations that additionally integrate ODoH.[50] It is available for a variety of operating systems, including Unix, Apple iOS, Linux, Android, and Windows.\nSecurity issues\n[edit]Originally, security concerns were not major design considerations for DNS software or any software for deployment on the early Internet, as the network was not open for participation by the general public. However, the expansion of the Internet into the commercial sector in the 1990s changed the requirements for security measures to protect data integrity and user authentication.\nSeveral vulnerability issues were discovered and exploited by malicious users. One such issue is DNS cache poisoning, in which data is distributed to caching resolvers under the pretense of being an authoritative origin server, thereby polluting the data store with potentially false information and long expiration times (time-to-live). Subsequently, legitimate application requests may be redirected to network hosts operated with malicious intent.\nDNS responses traditionally do not have a cryptographic signature, leading to many attack possibilities; the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses.[51] DNSCurve has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as TSIG, add support for cryptographic authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize zone transfer or dynamic update operations.\nTechniques such as forward-confirmed reverse DNS can also be used to help validate DNS results.\nDNS can also \"leak\" from otherwise secure or private connections, if attention is not paid to their configuration, and at times DNS has been used to bypass firewalls by malicious persons, and exfiltrate data, since it is often seen as innocuous.\nDNS spoofing\n[edit]Some domain names may be used to achieve spoofing effects. For example, paypal.com and paypa1.com are different names, yet users may be unable to distinguish them in a graphical user interface depending on the user's chosen typeface. In many fonts the letter l and the numeral 1 look very similar or even identical. This problem, known as the IDN homograph attack, is acute in systems that support internationalized domain names, as many character codes in ISO 10646 may appear identical on typical computer screens. This vulnerability is occasionally exploited in phishing.[52]\nDNSMessenger\n[edit]DNSMessenger[53][54][55][56] is a type of cyber attack technique that uses the DNS to communicate and control malware remotely without relying on conventional protocols that might raise red flags. The DNSMessenger attack is covert because DNS is primarily used for domain name resolution and is often not closely monitored by network security tools, making it an effective channel for attackers to exploit.\nThis technique involves the use of DNS TXT records to send commands to infected systems. Once malware has been surreptitiously installed on a victim's machine, it reaches out to a controlled domain to retrieve commands encoded in DNS text records. This form of malware communication is stealthy, as DNS requests are usually allowed through firewalls, and because DNS traffic is often seen as benign, these communications can bypass many network security defenses.\nDNSMessenger attacks can enable a wide array of malicious activities, from data exfiltration to the delivery of additional payloads, all while remaining under the radar of traditional network security measures. Understanding and defending against such methods are crucial for maintaining robust cybersecurity.\nPrivacy and tracking issues\n[edit]Originally designed as a public, hierarchical, distributed and heavily cached database, the DNS protocol has no confidentiality controls. User queries and nameserver responses are sent unencrypted, enabling network packet sniffing, DNS hijacking, DNS cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks. This deficiency is commonly used by cybercriminals and network operators for marketing purposes, user authentication on captive portals and censorship.[57]\nUser privacy is further exposed by proposals for increasing the level of client IP information in DNS queries (RFC 7871) for the benefit of content delivery networks.\nThe main approaches that are in use to counter privacy issues with DNS include:\n- VPNs, which move DNS resolution to the VPN operator and hide user traffic from the local ISP.\n- Tor, which replaces traditional DNS resolution with anonymous .onion domains, hiding both name resolution and user traffic behind onion routing counter-surveillance.\n- Proxies and public DNS servers, which move the actual DNS resolution to a trusted third-party provider.\n- Some public DNS servers may support security extensions such as DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS and DNSCrypt.\nSolutions preventing DNS inspection by the local network operator have been criticized for thwarting corporate network security policies and Internet censorship. Public DNS servers are also criticized for contributing to the centralization of the Internet by placing control over DNS resolution in the hands of the few large companies which can afford to run public resolvers.[57]\nGoogle is the dominant provider of the platform in Android, the browser in Chrome, and the DNS resolver in the 8.8.8.8 service. Would this scenario be a case of a single corporate entity being in a position of overarching control of the entire namespace of the Internet? Netflix already fielded an app that used its own DNS resolution mechanism independent of the platform upon which the app was running. What if the Facebook app included DoH? What if Apple's iOS used a DoH-resolution mechanism to bypass local DNS resolution and steer all DNS queries from Apple's platforms to a set of Apple-operated name resolvers?\n— DNS Privacy and the IETF\nDomain name registration\n[edit]The right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars which are accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or other organizations such as OpenNIC, that are charged with overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet. In addition to ICANN, each top-level domain (TLD) is maintained and serviced technically by an administrative organization, operating a registry. A registry is responsible for operating the database of names within its authoritative zone, although the term is most often used for TLDs. A registrant is a person or organization who asked for domain registration.[24] The registry receives registration information from each domain name registrar, which is authorized (accredited) to assign names in the corresponding zone and publishes the information using the WHOIS protocol. As of 2015, usage of RDAP is being considered.[58]\nICANN publishes the complete list of TLDs, TLD registries, and domain name registrars. Registrant information associated with domain names is maintained in an online database accessible with the WHOIS service. For most of the more than 290 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), the domain registries maintain the WHOIS (Registrant, name servers, expiration dates, etc.) information. For instance, DENIC, Germany NIC, holds the DE domain data. From about 2001, most Generic top-level domain (gTLD) registries have adopted this so-called thick registry approach, i.e. keeping the WHOIS data in central registries instead of registrar databases.\nFor top-level domains on COM and NET, a thin registry model is used. The domain registry (e.g., GoDaddy, BigRock and PDR, VeriSign, etc., etc.) holds basic WHOIS data (i.e., registrar and name servers, etc.). Organizations, or registrants using ORG on the other hand, are on the Public Interest Registry exclusively.\nSome domain name registries, often called network information centers (NIC), also function as registrars to end-users, in addition to providing access to the WHOIS datasets. The top-level domain registries, such as for the domains COM, NET, and ORG use a registry-registrar model consisting of many domain name registrars.[59] In this method of management, the registry only manages the domain name database and the relationship with the registrars. The registrants (users of a domain name) are customers of the registrar, in some cases through additional subcontracting of resellers.\nSee also\n[edit]- Alternative DNS root\n- Comparison of DNS server software\n- Decentralized object location and routing\n- DNS hijacking\n- DNS leak\n- DNS Long-Lived Queries\n- DNS management software\n- DNS over HTTPS\n- DNS over TLS\n- Domain hijacking\n- Hierarchical namespace\n- IPv6 brokenness and DNS whitelisting\n- List of DNS record types\n- List of managed DNS providers\n- Multicast DNS\n- Public recursive name server\n- resolv.conf\n- Split-horizon DNS\n- Timeline of the history of the Internet\n- Zone file\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Wu, Hao; Dang, Xianglei; Wang, Lidong; He, Longtao (2016). \"Information fusion-based method for distributed domain name system cache poisoning attack detection and identification\".

A transaction starts with a client submitting a request to the server, the server attempts to satisfy the request and returns a response to the client that describes the disposition of the request and optionally contains a requested resource such as an HTML document or other content.\nIn a common scenario, a web browser acts as the client, and a web server, hosting one or more websites, is the server. A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and other software that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.\nHTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, whenever possible, to reduce network traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.\nTo allow intermediate HTTP nodes (proxy servers, web caches, etc.) to accomplish their functions, some of the HTTP headers (found in HTTP requests/responses) are managed hop-by-hop whereas other HTTP headers are managed end-to-end (managed only by the source client and by the target web server).\nA web resource is located by a uniform resource locator (URL), using the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes http and https. URIs are encoded as hyperlinks in HTML documents, so as to form interlinked hypertext documents.[2]\nVersions\n[edit]The protocol has been revised over time. A version is identified as HTTP/# where # is the version number. This article covers aspects of all versions but provides primary coverage for HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1. Separate articles cover HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 in detail.\n| Version | Introduced | Status |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0.9 | 1991 | Obsolete |\n| 1.0 | 1996 | Obsolete |\n| 1.1 | 1997 | Standard |\n| 2 | 2015 | Standard |\n| 3 | 2022 | Standard |\nIn HTTP/1.0, a separate TCP connection to the same server is made for every resource request.[3]: §1.3\nIn HTTP/1.1, instead a TCP connection can be reused to make multiple resource requests (i.e. of HTML pages, frames, images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.).[4]: §9.1,9.3 HTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less latency as the establishment of TCP connections presents considerable overhead, especially under high traffic conditions.[5]\nEnhancements added with HTTP/2 allow for less latency and, in most cases, higher speeds than HTTP/1.1 communications. HTTP/2 adds support for:\n- a compressed binary representation of metadata (HTTP headers) instead of a textual one, so that headers require much less space;\n- a single TCP/IP (usually encrypted) connection per accessed server domain instead of 2 to 8 TCP/IP connections;\n- one or more bidirectional streams per TCP/IP connection in which HTTP requests and responses are broken down and transmitted in small packets to almost solve the problem of the HOLB (head-of-line blocking);[note 1]\n- a push capability to allow server application to send data to clients whenever new data is available (without forcing clients to request periodically new data to server by using polling methods).[6]: §2\nHTTP/3 uses QUIC + UDP transport protocols instead of TCP. Only the IP layer is used (which UDP, like TCP, builds on). This slightly improves the average speed of communications and avoids the occasional problem of TCP connection congestion that can temporarily block or slow down the data flow of all its streams (another form of \"head of line blocking\").\nUse\n[edit]HTTP/2 is supported by 66.2% of websites[7][8] (35.3% HTTP/2 + 30.9% HTTP/3 with backwards compatibility) and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users).[9] It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[10] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.[6]\nHTTP/3 is used on 30.9% of websites[11] and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users.[12] HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. In 2019, support for HTTP/3 was first added to Cloudflare and Chrome[13][14] and also enabled in Firefox.[15] HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages and loads faster than HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1, which is still commonly the only protocol enabled.[16]\nHTTPS, the secure variant of HTTP, is used by more than 85% of websites.[17]\nTechnology\n[edit]Transport layer\n[edit]HTTP presumes an underlying and reliable transport layer protocol.[1]: §3.3 The standard choice of the underlying protocol prior to HTTP/3 is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). HTTP/3 uses a different transport layer called QUIC, which provides reliability on top of the unreliable User Datagram Protocol (UDP). HTTP/1.1 and earlier have been adapted to be used over plain unreliable UDP in multicast and unicast situations, forming HTTPMU and HTTPU. They are used in UPnP and Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), two protocols usually run on a local area network.\nData exchange\n[edit]HTTP is a stateless application-level protocol and it requires a reliable network transport connection to exchange data between client and server.[18] In HTTP implementations, TCP/IP connections are used using well-known ports (typically port 80 if the connection is unencrypted or port 443 if the connection is encrypted, see also List of TCP and UDP port numbers).[1]: §4.2.1,4.2.2 In HTTP/2, a TCP/IP connection plus multiple protocol channels are used. In HTTP/3, the application transport protocol QUIC over UDP is used.\nRequest and response messages through connections\n[edit]Data is exchanged through a sequence of request–response messages which are exchanged by a session layer transport connection.[18] An HTTP client initially tries to establish a connection, real or virtual, with a server. An HTTP server listening on the port accepts the connection and then waits for a client's request message. The client sends its HTTP request message. Upon receiving the request the server sends back an HTTP response message, which includes header(s) plus a body if it is required. The body of this response message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned. At any time and for many reasons, either the client or server can close the connection. Closing a connection is usually advertised by one or more HTTP headers in the last request or response.[4]: §9.1\nPersistent connections\n[edit]In HTTP/0.9, the TCP/IP connection is always closed after server response has been sent, so it is never persistent.\nIn HTTP/1.0, the TCP/IP connection should always be closed by server after a response has been sent.[3][note 2]\nIn HTTP/1.1, a keep-alive-mechanism was officially introduced so that a connection could be reused for more than one request/response. Such persistent connections reduce request latency perceptibly because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that, in general, the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP's slow-start-mechanism.\nHTTP/1.1 added also HTTP pipelining in order to further reduce lag time when using persistent connections by allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response. This optimization was never considered really safe because a few web servers and many proxy servers, specially transparent proxy servers placed in Internet / Intranets between clients and servers, did not handle pipelined requests properly (they served only the first request discarding the others, they closed the connection because they saw more data after the first request or some proxies even returned responses out of order etc.). Because of this, only HEAD and some GET requests (i.e. limited to real file requests and so with URLs without query string used as a command, etc.) could be pipelined in a safe and idempotent mode. After many years of struggling with the problems introduced by enabling pipelining, this feature was first disabled and then removed from most browsers also because of the announced adoption of HTTP/2.\nHTTP/2 extended the usage of persistent connections by multiplexing many concurrent requests/responses through a single TCP/IP connection.\nHTTP/3 does not use TCP/IP connections but QUIC + UDP.\nContent retrieval optimizations\n[edit]In HTTP/0.9, a requested resource was always sent in its entirety.\nHTTP/1.0 added headers to manage resources cached by a client in order to allow conditional GET requests.\n- A server must return the entire content of the requested resource only if its last modified time is not known by the client or if it changed since the last full response to a GET request.\n- Header\nContent-Encoding\nwas added to specify whether the returned content is compressed.\n- If the size of the content is not known in advance (i.e. because it is dynamically generated) then the header\nContent-Length\nwould not be included. The client would assume that transfer was complete when the connection closed, but a premature close would leave the client with partial content yet the client would not know it's partial.\nHTTP/1.1 introduced and later versions provide:\n- Headers to better manage the conditional retrieval of cached resources.\n- Chunked transfer encoding allows content to be streamed in chunks in order to reliably send it even when the server does not know its length in advance (i.e. because it is dynamically generated, etc.).\n- Byte range serving allows a client to request portions (ranges of bytes) of a resource. This is useful to resume an interrupted download (when a file is very large), when only a part of a content has to be shown or dynamically added to the already visible part by a browser (i.e. only the first or the following n comments of a web page) in order to spare time, bandwidth and system resources, etc.\nApplication session\n[edit]As a stateless protocol, HTTP does not require the web server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. If a web application needs an application session, it implements it via HTTP cookies,[20] hidden variables in a web form or another mechanism.\nTypically, to start a session, an interactive login is performed, and to end a session, a logout is requested by the user. These kind of operations use a custom authentication mechanism, not HTTP authentication.\nAuthentication\n[edit]HTTP provides multiple authentication schemes such as basic access authentication and digest access authentication which operate via a challenge–response mechanism whereby the server identifies and issues a challenge before serving the requested content.\nHTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication, via an extensible set of challenge–response authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.[1]\nThe authentication mechanisms described above belong to the HTTP protocol and are managed by client and server HTTP software (if configured to require authentication before allowing client access to one or more web resources), and not by the web applications using an application session.\nThe HTTP authentication specification includes realms that provide an arbitrary, implementation-specific construct for further dividing resources common to a given root URI. The realm value string, if present, is combined with the canonical root URI to form the protection space component of the challenge. This in effect allows the server to define separate authentication scopes under one root URI.[1]\nEncrypted connection\n[edit]The most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTPS.[21] Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist: Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and using the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header to specify an upgrade to TLS. Browser support for these two is, however, nearly non-existent.[22][23][24]\nMessage format\n[edit]This section describes messages for HTTP/1.1. Later versions, HTTP/2[25] and HTTP/3, use a binary protocol, where headers are encoded in a single HEADERS\nand zero or more CONTINUATION\nframes using HPACK[26] (HTTP/2) or QPACK (HTTP/3), which both provide efficient header compression. The request or response line from HTTP/1 has also been replaced by several pseudo-header fields, each beginning with a colon (:\n).\nAt the highest level, a message consists of a header followed by a body.\nHeader\n[edit]A header consists of lines of ASCII text; each terminated with a carriage return and line feed sequence. The layout for both a request and a response header is:\n- Start line\n- Structured data that differs for request vs. response.\n- Header fields\n- Zero or more header field lines (at least 1 for HTTP/1.1); see below.\n- Empty line\n- Marks the end of the header.\nBody\n[edit]A body consists of data in any format; not limited to ASCII. The format must match that specified by the Content-Type\nheader field if the message contains one. A body is optional or, in other words, can be blank.\nEntity\n[edit]Before HTTP/2, the term entity was used to mean the body plus header fields that describe the body. In particular, not all headers were considered part of the entity. The term entity header referred to a header that was considered part of the entity, and sometimes the body was called the entity body. Modern documentation uses body and header without using entity.\nHeader field\n[edit]A header field represents metadata about its containing message such as how the body is encoded (via Content-Encoding), the session verification and identification of the client (as in browser cookies, IP address, user-agent) or their anonymity thereof (VPN or proxy masking, user-agent spoofing), how the server should handle data (as in Do-Not-Track or Global Privacy Control), the age (the time it has resided in a shared cache) of the document being downloaded, and much more. Generally, the information of a header field is used by software and not shown to the user.\nA header field line is formatted as a name-value pair with a colon separator. Whitespace is not allowed around the name, but leading and trailing whitespace is ignored for the value part. Unlike a method name that must match exactly (case-sensitive),[27] a header field name is matched ignoring case although often shown with each word capitalized.[28] For example, the following are header fields for Host\nand Accept-Language\n.\nHost: www.example.com Accept-Language: en\nThe standards do not limit the size of a header field or the number of fields in a message. However, most servers, clients, and proxy software impose limits for practical and security reasons. For example, the Apache 2.3 server by default limits the size of each field to 8190 bytes, and there can be at most 100 header fields in a single request.[29]\nAlthough deprecated by RFC 7230,[30] in the past, long lines could be split into multiple lines with a continuation line starting with a space or tab character.\nRequest\n[edit]A request is sent by a client to a server. The start line includes a method name, a request URI and the protocol version with a single space between each field.[31] The following request start line specifies method GET\n, URI /customer/123\nand protocol version HTTP/1.1\n:\nGET /customer/123 HTTP/1.1\nRequest header fields allow the client to pass additional information beyond the request line, acting as request modifiers (similarly to the parameters of a procedure). They give information about the client, about the target resource, or about the expected handling of the request. In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all header fields except Host\nare optional.\nA request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP/1.0 specification in RFC 1945.[32]\nResource\n[edit]The protocol structures transaction as operating on resources. What a resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable running on the server.\nMethod\n[edit]A request identifies a method (sometimes informally called verb) to classify the desired action to be performed on a resource. The HTTP/1.0 specification[3]: §8 defined the GET, HEAD, and POST methods as well as listing the PUT, DELETE, LINK and UNLINK methods under additional methods. However, the HTTP/1.1 specification[33]: §9 added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and non-idempotent method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined, which allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, WebDAV defined seven new methods and RFC 5789 specified the PATCH method. A general-purpose web server is required to implement at least GET and HEAD, and all other methods are considered optional by the specification.[1]: §9.1\nMethod names are case sensitive.[4]: §3 [1]: §9.1 This is in contrast to HTTP header field names which are case-insensitive.[1]: §6.3\n- GET\n- The request is for a representation of a resource. The server should only retrieve data; not modify state.[1] For retrieving without making changes, GET is preferred over POST, as it can be addressed through a URL.[clarification needed] This enables bookmarking and sharing and makes GET responses eligible for caching, which can save bandwidth. The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, \"Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.\"[34]\n- HEAD\n- The request is like a GET except that the response should not include the representation data in the body. This is useful for retrieving the representation metadata in the response header, without having to transfer the entire representation. Uses include checking whether a page is available via the status code and getting the size of a file via header field\nContent-Length\n.\n- POST\n- The request is to process a resource in some way. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction.[1]: §9.3.3\n- PUT\n- The request is to create or update a resource with the state in the request. A distinction from POST is that the client specifies the target location on the server.[1]: §9.3.4\n- DELETE\n- The request is to delete a resource.\n- CONNECT\n- Requests that the intermediary establish a TCP/IP tunnel to the origin server identified by the request target. It is often used to secure connections through one or more HTTP proxies with TLS.[1]: §9.3.6 [35] See HTTP CONNECT method.\n- OPTIONS\n- Request is for a report of the HTTP methods that are supported for a resource. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.\n- TRACE\n- Requests the server to respond with the received request in the response body. That way a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediaries. Useful for debugging.\n- PATCH\n- The request is to modify a resource according to its partial state in the request. Compared to PUT, this can save bandwidth by sending only part of a resource's representation instead of all of it.[36]\n| Method | RFC | Request has payload body |\nResponse has payload body |\nSafe | Idempotent | Cacheable |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| GET | RFC 9110 | Optional | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| HEAD | RFC 9110 | Optional | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| POST | RFC 9110 | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |\n| PUT | RFC 9110 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No |\n| DELETE | RFC 9110 | Optional | Yes | No | Yes | No |\n| CONNECT | RFC 9110 | Optional | Yes | No | No | No |\n| OPTIONS | RFC 9110 | Optional | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| TRACE | RFC 9110 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| PATCH | RFC 5789 | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |\nSafe method\n[edit]A request method is safe if a request with that method has no intended effect on the server. The methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are defined as safe. In other words, safe methods are intended to be read-only. Safe methods can still have side effects not seen by the client, such as appending request information to a log file or charging an advertising account.\nIn contrast, the methods POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, and PATCH are not safe. They may modify the state of the server or have other effects such as sending an email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.\nDespite the prescribed safety of GET requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Careless or deliberately irregular programming can allow GET requests to cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged because of the problems which can occur when web caching, search engines, and other automated agents make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as https://example.com/article/1234/delete, which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using GET, would simply delete the article.[37] A properly coded website would require a DELETE or POST method for this action, which non-malicious bots would not make.\nOne example of this occurring in practice was during the short-lived Google Web Accelerator beta, which prefetched arbitrary URLs on the page a user was viewing, causing records to be automatically altered or deleted en masse. The beta was suspended only weeks after its first release, following widespread criticism.[38][37]\nIdempotent method\n[edit]A request method is idempotent if multiple identical requests with that method have the same effect as a single such request. The methods PUT and DELETE, and safe methods are defined as idempotent. Safe methods are trivially idempotent, since they are intended to have no effect on the server whatsoever; the PUT and DELETE methods, meanwhile, are idempotent since successive identical requests will be ignored. A website might, for instance, set up a PUT endpoint to modify a user's recorded email address. If this endpoint is configured correctly, any requests which ask to change a user's email address to the same email address which is already recorded—e.g. duplicate requests following a successful request—will have no effect. Similarly, a request to DELETE a certain user will have no effect if that user has already been deleted.\nIn contrast, the methods POST, CONNECT, and PATCH are not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further modify the state of the server or have further effects, such as sending multiple emails. In some cases this is the desired effect, but in other cases it may occur accidentally. A user might, for example, inadvertently send multiple POST requests by clicking a button again if they were not given clear feedback that the first click was being processed. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.\nNote that whether or not a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. To do so against recommendations, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.\nCacheable method\n[edit]A request method is cacheable if responses to requests with that method may be stored for future reuse. The methods GET, HEAD, and POST are defined as cacheable.\nIn contrast, the methods PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, and PATCH are not cacheable.\nResponse\n[edit]A response is sent to the client by the server. The start line of a response consists of the protocol version, a status code and optionally a reason phrase with fields separated by a single space character. [4]: §2.1 The following response start line specifies protocol version HTTP/1.1\n, status code 400\nand reason phrase Bad Request\n.\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nResponse header fields allow the server to pass additional information beyond the status line, acting as response modifiers. They give information about the server or about further access to the target resource or related resources. Each response header field has a defined meaning which can be further refined by the semantics of the request method or response status code.\nStatus code\n[edit]The status code is a three-digit, decimal, integer value that represents the disposition of the server's attempt to satisfy the client's request. Generally, a client handles a response primarily based on the status code and secondarily on response header fields. A client may not understand each status code that a server reports but it must understand the class as indicated by the first digit and treat an unrecognized code as equivalent to the x00 code of that class. The classes are as follows:\n- 1XX informational\n- The request was received, continuing process.\n- 2XX successful\n- The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.\n- 3XX redirection\n- Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.\n- 4XX client error\n- The request cannot be fulfilled due to an issue that the client might be able to control.\n- 5XX server error\n- The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.\nReason phrase\n[edit]The standard reason phrases are only recommendations. A web server is allowed to use a localized equivalent. If a status code indicates a problem, the user agent might display the reason phrase to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the reason phrase, though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and reason phrases are human-readable.\nExample\n[edit]The following demonstrates an HTTP/1.1 request-response transaction for a server at www.example.com, port 80. HTTP/1.0 would use the same messages except for a few missing headers. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 would use the same request-response mechanism but with different representations for HTTP headers.\nThe following is a request with no body. It consists of a start line, 6 header fields and a blank line – each terminated with a carriage return and line feed sequence. The Host\nheader field distinguishes between various DNS names sharing a single IP address, allowing name-based virtual hosting. While optional in HTTP/1.0, it is mandatory in HTTP/1.1.\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nConnection: keep-alive\nAlthough not clear in the representation above (due to limitations of this wiki), the blank line at the end results in ending in two line terminator sequences. Represented as a stream of characters, a shorted version of above shows this more clearly with <CRLF>\nrepresenting a line terminator sequence: GET / HTTP/1.1<CRLF>Host: www.example.com<CRLF><CRLF>\n.\nIn the following response, the ETag (entity tag) header field is used to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server. The Content-Type\nheader field specifies the Internet media type of the data conveyed by the HTTP message, and Content-Length\nindicates its length in bytes. The HTTP/1.1 webserver publishes its ability to respond to requests for a byte range of the resource by including Accept-Ranges: bytes\n. This is useful, if the client needs to have only certain portions[39] of a resource sent by the server, which is called byte serving. When Connection: close\nis sent, it means that the web server will close the TCP connection immediately after the end of the transfer of this response.[4]: §9.1\nMost of the header fields are optional but some are mandatory. When header Content-Length\nis missing from a response with a body, then this should be considered an error in HTTP/1.0 but it may not be an error in HTTP/1.1 if header Transfer-Encoding: chunked\nis present. Chunked transfer encoding uses a chunk size of 0 to mark the end of the content. Some old implementations of HTTP/1.0 omitted the header Content-Length\nwhen the length of the body was not known at the beginning of the response and so the transfer of data to client continued until server closed the socket.\nContent-Encoding: gzip\ninforms the client that the body is compressed per the gzip algorithm.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 23 May 2005 22:38:34 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 155\nLast-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 23:11:55 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)\nETag: \"3f80f-1b6-3e1cb03b\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nConnection: close\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>An Example Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<p>Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\nSimilar protocols\n[edit]- Gopher protocol\n- A content delivery protocol that was displaced by HTTP in the early 1990s.\n- SPDY protocol\n- An alternative to HTTP developed at Google, superseded by HTTP/2.\n- Gemini protocol\n- A Gopher-inspired protocol which mandates privacy-related features.\nHistory\n[edit]Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN are credited with inventing HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a client user interface called web browser. Berners-Lee designed HTTP in order to help with the adoption of his other idea: the \"WorldWideWeb\" project, which was first proposed in 1989, now known as the World Wide Web. Development of HTTP was initiated in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP version, named 0.9.[40] That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public 1.0.[41] Development of early HTTP Request for Comments (RFC) documents started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.\nThe first web server went live in 1990.[42][43] The protocol used had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server.[44] The response from the server was always an HTML page.[40]\nHTTP/0.9\n[edit]In 1991, the first documented official version of HTTP was written as a plain document, less than 700 words long, and this version was named HTTP/0.9, which supported only GET method, allowing clients to only retrieve HTML documents from the server, but not supporting any other file formats or information upload.[40]\nHTTP/1.0-draft\n[edit]Since 1992, a new document was written to specify the evolution of the basic protocol towards its next full version. It supported both the simple request method of the 0.9 version and the full GET request that included the client HTTP version. This was the first of the many unofficial HTTP/1.0 drafts that preceded the final work on HTTP/1.0.[41]\nW3C HTTP Working Group\n[edit]After having decided that new features of HTTP protocol were required and that they had to be fully documented as official RFC documents, in early 1995, the HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG, led by Dave Raggett) was constituted with the aim to standardize and expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields.[45][46]\nThe HTTP WG planned to revise and publish new versions of the protocol as HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 within 1995, but, because of the many revisions, that timeline lasted much more than one year.[47]\nThe HTTP WG planned also to specify a far future version of HTTP called HTTP-NG (HTTP Next Generation) that would have solved all remaining problems, of previous versions, related to performances, low latency responses, etc. but this work started only a few years later and it was never completed.\nHTTP/1.0\n[edit]In May 1996, RFC 1945[3] was published as a final HTTP/1.0 revision of what had been used in previous 4 years as a pre-standard HTTP/1.0-draft which was already used by many web browsers and web servers.\nIn early 1996 developers started to even include unofficial extensions of the HTTP/1.0 protocol (i.e. keep-alive connections, etc.) into their products by using drafts of the upcoming HTTP/1.1 specifications.[19]\nHTTP/1.1\n[edit]Since early 1996, major web browsers and web server developers also started to implement new features specified by pre-standard HTTP/1.1 drafts specifications. End-user adoption of the new versions of browsers and servers was rapid. In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of browsers in use on the Internet used the new HTTP/1.1 header \"Host\" to enable virtual hosting, and that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers accessing their servers were pre-standard HTTP/1.1 compliant.[48]\nIn January 1997, RFC 2068[49] was officially released as HTTP/1.1 specifications.\nIn June 1999, RFC 2616[33] was released to include all improvements and updates based on previous (obsolete) HTTP/1.1 specifications.\nW3C HTTP-NG Working Group\n[edit]Resuming the old 1995 plan of previous HTTP Working Group, in 1997 an HTTP-NG Working Group was formed to develop a new HTTP protocol named HTTP-NG (HTTP New Generation). A few proposals / drafts were produced for the new protocol to use multiplexing of HTTP transactions inside a single TCP/IP connection, but in 1999, the group stopped its activity passing the technical problems to IETF.[50]\nIETF HTTP Working Group restarted\n[edit]In 2007, the IETF HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG bis or HTTPbis) was restarted firstly to revise and clarify previous HTTP/1.1 specifications and secondly to write and refine future HTTP/2 specifications (named httpbis).[51][52]\nSPDY\n[edit]In 2009, Google announced SPDY – a binary protocol they developed to speed up web traffic between browsers and servers. In many tests, using SPDY was indeed faster than using HTTP/1.1. SPDY was integrated into Google's Chromium and then into other major web browsers.[53] Some of the ideas about multiplexing HTTP streams over a single TCP connection were taken from various sources, including the work of W3C HTTP-NG Working Group.\nHTTP/2\n[edit]In 2012, HTTP Working Group (HTTPbis) announced the need for a new protocol; initially considering aspects of SPDY[54][55] and eventually deciding to derive the new protocol from SPDY.[56] In May 2015, HTTP/2 was published as RFC 7540[57]. The protocol was quickly adopted by web browsers already supporting SPDY and more slowly by web servers.\n2014 updates to HTTP/1.1\n[edit]In June 2014, the HTTP Working Group released an updated six-part HTTP/1.1 specification obsoleting RFC 2616[33]:\n- RFC 7230 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing,\"[58] Obsolete.\n- RFC 7231 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content,\"[59] Obsolete.\n- RFC 7232 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests,\"[60] Obsolete.\n- RFC 7233 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests,\"[61] Obsolete.\n- RFC 7234 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching,\"[62] Obsolete.\n- RFC 7235 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication,\"[63] Obsolete.\nHTTP/0.9 Deprecation\n[edit]In 2014, HTTP/0.9 was deprecated for servers supporting version HTTP/1.1 (and higher):[58]: §Appendix A\nSince HTTP/0.9 did not support header fields in a request, there is no mechanism for it to support name-based virtual hosts (selection of resource by inspection of the Host header field). Any server that implements name-based virtual hosts ought to disable support for HTTP/0.9. Most requests that appear to be HTTP/0.9 are, in fact, badly constructed HTTP/1.x requests caused by a client failing to properly encode the request-target.\nSince 2016 many product managers and developers of user agents (browsers, etc.) and web servers have begun planning to gradually deprecate and dismiss support for HTTP/0.9 protocol, mainly for the following reasons:[64]\n- it is so simple that an RFC document was never written (there is only the original document);[40]\n- it has no HTTP headers and lacks many other features that nowadays are required for minimal security reasons;\n- it has not been widespread since 1999..2000 (because of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1) and is commonly used only by some very old network hardware, i.e. routers, etc.\nAs of 2022, HTTP/0.9 support has not been officially, completely deprecated and is still present in many web servers and browsers (for server responses only), even if usually disabled. It is unclear how long it will take to decommission HTTP/0.9.\nHTTP/3\n[edit]In 2020, the first drafts of HTTP/3 were published and major web browsers and web servers started to adopt it. On 6 June 2022, IETF standardized HTTP/3 as RFC 9114[65].\nUpdates and refactoring in 2022\n[edit]In June 2022, RFC documents were published that deprecated many of the previous documents and introducing a few minor changes and a refactoring of HTTP semantics description into a separate document.\n- RFC 9110 – \"HTTP Semantics,\"[1] Internet Standard 97.\n- RFC 9111 – \"HTTP Caching,\"[66] Internet Standard 98.\n- RFC 9112 – \"HTTP/1.1,\"[4] Internet Standard 99.\n- RFC 9113 – \"HTTP/2,\"[6] Proposed Standard.\n- RFC 9114 – \"HTTP/3,\"[65] Proposed Standard. (See also the section above.)\n- RFC 9204 – \"QPACK: Field Compression for HTTP/3,\"[67] Proposed Standard.\n- RFC 9218 – \"Extensible Prioritization Scheme for HTTP,\"[68] Proposed Standard.\nSee also\n[edit]- Comparison of file transfer protocols\n- Constrained Application Protocol – Specialized Internet application protocol\n- Content negotiation – Serving multiple documents at the same:;URI\n- Digest access authentication – Method of negotiating credentials between web server and browser\n- InterPlanetary File System – Content-addressable, peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol\n- HTTP compression – Capability that can be built into web servers and web clients\n- Representational state transfer – Architectural style for client-server applications\n- Variant object\n- Web cache – System for optimizing the Web\n- WebSocket – Computer network protocol\n- Wireless Application Protocol – Deprecated technical standard for data access over a cellular network\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ In practice, these streams are used as multiple TCP/IP sub-connections to multiplex concurrent requests/responses, thus greatly reducing the number of real TCP/IP connections on server side, from 2..8 per client to 1, and allowing many more clients to be served at once.\n- ^ Since late 1996, some developers of popular HTTP/1.0 browsers and servers (specially those who had planned support for HTTP/1.1 too), started to deploy (as an unofficial extension) a sort of keep-alive-mechanism (by using new HTTP headers) in order to keep the TCP/IP connection open for more than a request/response pair and so to speed up the exchange of multiple requests/responses.[19]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m R.

It uses encryption for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.[1][2] In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS,[3] or HTTP over SSL.\nThe principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while it is in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional block cipher encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering.[4][5] The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates. This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier Foundation with the support of web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent.[6] HTTPS has since 2018[7] been used more often by web users than non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types of websites, secure accounts, and keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.\nOverview\n[edit]The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme HTTPS has identical usage syntax to the HTTP scheme. However, HTTPS signals the browser to use an added encryption layer of SSL/TLS to protect the traffic. SSL/TLS is especially suited for HTTP, since it can provide some protection even if only one side of the communication is authenticated. This is the case with HTTP transactions over the Internet, where typically only the server is authenticated (by the client examining the server's certificate).\nHTTPS creates a secure channel over an insecure network. This ensures reasonable protection from eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle attacks, provided that adequate cipher suites are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted.\nBecause HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request's URL, query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identifying information about the user). However, because website addresses and port numbers are necessarily part of the underlying TCP/IP protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server, and sometimes even the domain name (e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that a user is communicating with, along with the amount of data transferred and the duration of the communication, though not the content of the communication.[4]\nWeb browsers know how to trust HTTPS websites based on certificate authorities that come pre-installed in their software. Certificate authorities are in this way being trusted by web browser creators to provide valid certificates. Therefore, a user should trust an HTTPS connection to a website if and only if all of the following are true:\n- The user trusts that their device, hosting the browser and the method to get the browser itself, is not compromised (i.e. there is no supply chain attack).\n- The user trusts that the browser software correctly implements HTTPS with correctly pre-installed certificate authorities.\n- The user trusts the certificate authority to vouch only for legitimate websites (i.e. the certificate authority is not compromised and there is no mis-issuance of certificates).\n- The website provides a valid certificate, which means it was signed by a trusted authority.\n- The certificate correctly identifies the website (e.g., when the browser visits \"https://example.com\", the received certificate is properly for \"example.com\" and not some other entity).\n- The user trusts that the protocol's encryption layer (SSL/TLS) is sufficiently secure against eavesdroppers.\nHTTPS is especially important over insecure networks and networks that may be subject to tampering. Insecure networks, such as public Wi-Fi access points, allow anyone on the same local network to packet-sniff and discover sensitive information not protected by HTTPS. Additionally, some free-to-use and paid WLAN networks have been observed tampering with webpages by engaging in packet injection in order to serve their own ads on other websites. This practice can be exploited maliciously in many ways, such as by injecting malware onto webpages and stealing users' private information.[8]\nHTTPS is also important for connections over the Tor network, as malicious Tor nodes could otherwise damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is one reason why the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Tor Project started the development of HTTPS Everywhere,[4] which is included in Tor Browser.[9]\nAs more information is revealed about global mass surveillance and criminals stealing personal information, the use of HTTPS security on all websites is becoming increasingly important regardless of the type of Internet connection being used.[10][11] Even though metadata about individual pages that a user visits might not be considered sensitive, when aggregated it can reveal a lot about the user and compromise the user's privacy.[12][13][14]\nDeploying HTTPS also allows the use of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (and their predecessors SPDY and QUIC), which are new HTTP versions designed to reduce page load times, size, and latency.\nIt is recommended to use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with HTTPS to protect users from man-in-the-middle attacks, especially SSL stripping.[14][15]\nHTTPS should not be confused with the seldom-used Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) specified in RFC 2660.\nUsage in websites\n[edit]As of April 2018[update], 33.2% of Alexa top 1,000,000 websites use HTTPS as default[16] and 70% of page loads (measured by Firefox Telemetry) use HTTPS.[17] As of June 2025[update], 71.2% of the Internet's 150,000 most popular websites have a secure implementation of HTTPS (up from 58.4% in December 2022),[18] However, despite TLS 1.3's release in 2018, adoption has been slow, with many still remaining on the older TLS 1.2 protocol.[19]\nBrowser integration\n[edit]Most browsers display a warning if they receive an invalid certificate. Older browsers, when connecting to a site with an invalid certificate, would present the user with a dialog box asking whether they wanted to continue. Newer browsers display a warning across the entire window. Newer browsers also prominently display the site's security information in the address bar. Extended validation certificates show the legal entity on the certificate information. Most browsers also display a warning to the user when visiting a site that contains a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted content. Additionally, many web filters return a security warning when visiting prohibited websites.\n-\nMany web browsers, including Firefox (shown here), use the address bar to tell the user that their connection is secure, an Extended Validation Certificate should identify the legal entity for the certificate.\n-\nMost web browsers alert the user when visiting sites that have invalid security certificates.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, opining that \"In an ideal world, every web request could be defaulted to HTTPS\", has provided an add-on called HTTPS Everywhere for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium, and Android, which enables HTTPS by default for hundreds of frequently used websites.[20][21]\nForcing a web browser to load only HTTPS content has been supported in Firefox starting in version 83.[22] Starting in version 94, Google Chrome is able to \"always use secure connections\" if toggled in the browser's settings.[23][24]\nSecurity\n[edit]The security of HTTPS is that of the underlying TLS, which typically uses long-term public and private keys to generate a short-term session key, which is then used to encrypt the data flow between the client and the server. X.509 certificates are used to authenticate the server (and sometimes the client as well). As a consequence, certificate authorities and public key certificates are necessary to verify the relation between the certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more beneficial than verifying the identities via a web of trust, the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures drew attention to certificate authorities as a potential weak point allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.[25][26] An important property in this context is forward secrecy, which ensures that encrypted communications recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future. Not all web servers provide forward secrecy.[27][needs update]\nFor HTTPS to be effective, a site must be completely hosted over HTTPS. If some of the site's contents are loaded over HTTP (scripts or images, for example), or if only a certain page that contains sensitive information, such as a log-in page, is loaded over HTTPS while the rest of the site is loaded over plain HTTP, the user will be vulnerable to attacks and surveillance. Additionally, cookies on a site served through HTTPS must have the secure attribute enabled. On a site that has sensitive information on it, the user and the session will get exposed every time that site is accessed with HTTP instead of HTTPS.[14]\nTechnical\n[edit]Difference from HTTP\n[edit]HTTPS URLs begin with \"https://\" and use port 443 by default, whereas HTTP URLs begin with \"http://\" and use port 80 by default.\nHTTP is not encrypted and thus is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks, which can let attackers gain access to website accounts and sensitive information, and modify webpages to inject malware or advertisements. HTTPS is designed to withstand such attacks and is considered secure against them (with the exception of HTTPS implementations that use deprecated versions of SSL).\nNetwork layers\n[edit]HTTP operates at the highest layer of the TCP/IP model—the application layer; as does the TLS security protocol (operating as a lower sublayer of the same layer), which encrypts an HTTP message prior to transmission and decrypts a message upon arrival. Strictly speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol, but refers to the use of ordinary HTTP over an encrypted SSL/TLS connection.\nHTTPS encrypts all message contents, including the HTTP headers and the request/response data. With the exception of the possible CCA cryptographic attack described in the limitations section below, an attacker should at most be able to discover that a connection is taking place between two parties, along with their domain names and IP addresses.\nServer setup\n[edit]To prepare a web server to accept HTTPS connections, the administrator must create a public key certificate for the web server. This certificate must be signed by a trusted certificate authority for the web browser to accept it without warning. The authority certifies that the certificate holder is the operator of the web server that presents it. Web browsers are generally distributed with a list of signing certificates of major certificate authorities so that they can verify certificates signed by them.\nAcquiring certificates\n[edit]A number of commercial certificate authorities exist, offering paid-for SSL/TLS certificates of a number of types, including Extended Validation Certificates.\nLet's Encrypt, launched in April 2016,[28] provides free and automated service that delivers basic SSL/TLS certificates to websites.[29] According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Let's Encrypt will make switching from HTTP to HTTPS \"as easy as issuing one command, or clicking one button.\"[30] The majority of web hosts and cloud providers now leverage Let's Encrypt, providing free certificates to their customers.\nUse as access control\n[edit]The system can also be used for client authentication in order to limit access to a web server to authorized users. To do this, the site administrator typically creates a certificate for each user, which the user loads into their browser. Normally, the certificate contains the name and e-mail address of the authorized user and is automatically checked by the server on each connection to verify the user's identity, potentially without even requiring a password.\nIn case of compromised secret (private) key\n[edit]An important property in this context is perfect forward secrecy (PFS). Possessing one of the long-term asymmetric secret keys used to establish an HTTPS session should not make it easier to derive the short-term session key to then decrypt the conversation, even at a later time. Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DHE) and Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman key exchange (ECDHE) are in 2013 the only schemes known to have that property. In 2013, only 30% of Firefox, Opera, and Chromium Browser sessions used it, and nearly 0% of Apple's Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer sessions.[27] TLS 1.3, published in August 2018, dropped support for ciphers without forward secrecy. As of February 2019[update], 96.6% of web servers surveyed support some form of forward secrecy, and 52.1% will use forward secrecy with most browsers.[31] As of July 2023[update], 99.6% of web servers surveyed support some form of forward secrecy, and 75.2% will use forward secrecy with most browsers.[32]\nCertificate revocation\n[edit]A certificate may be revoked before it expires, for example because the secrecy of the private key has been compromised. Newer versions of popular browsers such as Firefox,[33] Opera,[34] and Internet Explorer on Windows Vista[35] implement the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to verify that this is not the case. The browser sends the certificate's serial number to the certificate authority or its delegate via OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) and the authority responds, telling the browser whether the certificate is still valid or not.[36] The CA may also issue a CRL to tell people that these certificates are revoked. CRLs are no longer required by the CA/Browser forum,[37][needs update] nevertheless, they are still widely used by the CAs. Most revocation statuses on the Internet disappear soon after the expiration of the certificates.[38]\nLimitations\n[edit]SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption can be configured in two modes: simple and mutual. In simple mode, authentication is only performed by the server. The mutual version requires the user to install a personal client certificate in the web browser for user authentication.[39] In either case, the level of protection depends on the correctness of the implementation of the software and the cryptographic algorithms in use.[citation needed]\nSSL/TLS does not prevent the indexing of the site by a web crawler, and in some cases the URI of the encrypted resource can be inferred by knowing only the intercepted request/response size.[40] This allows an attacker to have access to the plaintext (the publicly available static content), and the encrypted text (the encrypted version of the static content), permitting a cryptographic attack.[citation needed]\nBecause TLS operates at a protocol level below that of HTTP and has no knowledge of the higher-level protocols, TLS servers can only strictly present one certificate for a particular address and port combination.[41] In the past, this meant that it was not feasible to use name-based virtual hosting with HTTPS. A solution called Server Name Indication (SNI) exists, which sends the hostname to the server before encrypting the connection, although older browsers do not support this extension. Support for SNI is available since Firefox 2, Opera 8, Apple Safari 2.1, Google Chrome 6, and Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista.[42][43][44]\nA sophisticated type of man-in-the-middle attack called SSL stripping was presented at the 2009 Blackhat Conference. This type of attack defeats the security provided by HTTPS by changing the https:\nlink into an http:\nlink, taking advantage of the fact that few Internet users actually type \"https\" into their browser interface: they get to a secure site by clicking on a link, and thus are fooled into thinking that they are using HTTPS when in fact they are using HTTP. The attacker then communicates in clear with the client.[45] This prompted the development of a countermeasure in HTTP called HTTP Strict Transport Security.[citation needed]\nHTTPS has been shown to be vulnerable to a range of traffic analysis attacks. Traffic analysis attacks are a type of side-channel attack that relies on variations in the timing and size of traffic in order to infer properties about the encrypted traffic itself. Traffic analysis is possible because SSL/TLS encryption changes the contents of traffic, but has minimal impact on the size and timing of traffic. In May 2010, a research paper by researchers from Microsoft Research and Indiana University discovered that detailed sensitive user data can be inferred from side channels such as packet sizes. The researchers found that, despite HTTPS protection in several high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment, and web search, an eavesdropper could infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, his/her family income, and investment secrets.[46]\nThe fact that most modern websites, including Google, Yahoo!, and Amazon, use HTTPS causes problems for many users trying to access public Wi-Fi hot spots, because a captive portal Wi-Fi hot spot login page fails to load if the user tries to open an HTTPS resource.[47] Several websites, such as NoSSL.sh, guarantee that they will always remain accessible by HTTP[48].\nHistory\n[edit]Netscape Communications created HTTPS in 1994 for its Netscape Navigator web browser.[49] Originally, HTTPS was used with the SSL protocol.[50] The original SSL protocol was developed by Taher Elgamal, chief scientist at Netscape Communications.[51][52][53] As SSL evolved into Transport Layer Security (TLS), HTTPS was formally specified by RFC 2818[54] in May 2000. Google announced in February 2018 that its Chrome browser would mark HTTP sites as \"Not Secure\" after July 2018.[50] This move was to encourage website owners to implement HTTPS, as an effort to make the World Wide Web more secure.\nSee also\n[edit]- Transport Layer Security\n- Bullrun (decryption program) – a secret anti-encryption program run by the US National Security Agency\n- Computer security\n- HSTS\n- Opportunistic encryption\n- Stunnel\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Secure your site with HTTPS\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer", "title": "Transport layer - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Transport layer\nThis article may be too technical for most readers to understand.(March 2025) |\n| Internet protocol suite |\n|---|\n| Application layer |\n| Transport layer |\n| Internet layer |\n| Link layer |\nIn computer networking, the transport layer is a conceptual division of methods in the layered architecture of protocols in the network stack in the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model. The protocols of this layer provide end-to-end communication services for applications.[1]: §1.1.3 It provides services such as connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing.\nThe details of implementation and semantics of the transport layer of the Internet protocol suite,[1], which is the foundation of the Internet, and the OSI model of general networking are different. The protocols in use today in this layer for the Internet all originated in the development of TCP/IP. In the OSI model, the transport layer is often referred to as Layer 4, or L4,[2] while numbered layers are not used in TCP/IP.\nThe best-known transport protocol of the Internet protocol suite is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It is used for connection-oriented transmissions, whereas the connectionless User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used for simpler messaging transmissions. TCP is the more complex protocol, due to its stateful design, incorporating reliable transmission and data stream services. Together, TCP and UDP comprise essentially all traffic on the Internet and are the only protocols implemented in every major operating system. Additional transport layer protocols that have been defined and implemented include the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).\n| OSI model by layer |\n|---|\nServices\n[edit]Transport layer services are conveyed to an application via a programming interface to the transport layer protocols. The services may include the following features:[4]\n- Connection-oriented communication:[5] It is normally easier for an application to interpret a connection as a data stream rather than having to deal with the underlying connection-less models, such as the datagram model of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and of the Internet Protocol (IP).\n- Same order delivery: The network layer doesn't generally guarantee that packets of data will arrive in the same order that they were sent, but often this is a desirable feature. This is usually done through the use of segment numbering, with the receiver passing them to the application in order. This can cause head-of-line blocking.\n- Reliability: Packets may be lost during transport due to network congestion and errors. By means of an error detection code, such as a checksum, the transport protocol may check that the data is not corrupted, and verify correct receipt by sending an ACK or NACK message to the sender. Automatic repeat request schemes may be used to retransmit lost or corrupted data.\n- Flow control: The rate of data transmission between two nodes must sometimes be managed to prevent a fast sender from transmitting more data than can be supported by the receiving data buffer, causing a buffer overrun. This can also be used to improve efficiency by reducing buffer underrun.\n- Congestion avoidance: Congestion control can control traffic entry into a telecommunications network, so as to avoid congestive collapse by attempting to avoid oversubscription of any of the processing or link capabilities of the intermediate nodes and networks and taking resource reducing steps, such as reducing the rate of sending packets. For example, automatic repeat requests may keep the network in a congested state; this situation can be avoided by adding congestion avoidance to the flow control, including slow start. This keeps the bandwidth consumption at a low level in the beginning of the transmission, or after packet retransmission.\n- Multiplexing: Ports can provide multiple endpoints on a single node. For example, the name on a postal address is a kind of multiplexing and distinguishes between different recipients of the same location. Computer applications will each listen for information on their own ports, which enables the use of more than one network service at the same time. It is part of the transport layer in the TCP/IP model, but of the session layer in the OSI model.\nAnalysis\n[edit]The transport layer is responsible for delivering data to the appropriate application process on the host computers. This involves statistical multiplexing of data from different application processes, i.e., forming data segments, and adding source and destination port numbers in the header of each transport layer data segment. Together with the source and destination IP address, the port numbers constitute a network socket, i.e., an identification address of the process-to-process communication. In the OSI model, this function is supported by the session layer.\nSome transport layer protocols, for example TCP, but not UDP, support virtual circuits, i.e., provide connection-oriented communication over an underlying packet-oriented datagram network. A byte stream is delivered while hiding the packet mode communication for the application processes. This involves connection establishment, dividing of the data stream into packets called segments, segment numbering and reordering of out-of-order data.\nFinally, some transport layer protocols, for example TCP, but not UDP, provide end-to-end reliable communication, i.e., error recovery by means of error detecting code and automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol. The ARQ protocol also provides flow control, which may be combined with congestion avoidance.\nUDP is a very simple protocol and does not provide virtual circuits, nor reliable communication, delegating these functions to the application program. UDP packets are called datagrams, rather than segments.\nTCP is used for many protocols, including HTTP web browsing and email transfer. UDP may be used for multicasting and broadcasting, since retransmissions are not possible to a large number of hosts. UDP typically gives higher throughput and shorter latency and is therefore often used for real-time multimedia communication where packet loss occasionally can be accepted, for example, IP-TV and IP-telephony, and for online computer games.\nMany non-IP-based networks, such as X.25, Frame Relay and ATM, implement connection-oriented communication at the network or data link layer rather than the transport layer. In X.25, in telephone network modems and in wireless communication systems, reliable node-to-node communication is implemented at lower protocol layers.\nThe OSI connection-mode transport layer protocol specification defines five classes of transport protocols: TP0, providing the least error recovery, to TP4, which is designed for less reliable networks.\nDue to protocol ossification, TCP and UDP are the only widely used transport protocols on the Internet.[6] To avoid middlebox intolerance, new transport protocols may mimic the wire image of a tolerated protocol, or be encapsulated in UDP, accepting some overhead (e.g., due to outer checksums made redundant by inner integrity checks).[7] QUIC takes the latter approach, rebuilding reliable stream transport on top of UDP.[8]\nProtocols\n[edit]This list shows some protocols that are commonly placed in the transport layers of the Internet protocol suite, the OSI protocol suite, NetWare's IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, and Fibre Channel.\n- ATP, AppleTalk Transaction Protocol\n- CUDP, Cyclic UDP[9]\n- DCCP, Datagram Congestion Control Protocol\n- FCP, Fibre Channel Protocol\n- IL, IL Protocol\n- MPTCP, Multipath TCP\n- NORM, NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast\n- QUIC\n- RDP, Reliable Data Protocol\n- RUDP, Reliable User Datagram Protocol\n- SCTP, Stream Control Transmission Protocol\n- SPX, Sequenced Packet Exchange\n- SST, Structured Stream Transport\n- TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n- UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n- UDP-Lite\n- μTP, Micro Transport Protocol\nComparison of Internet transport layer protocols\n[edit]| Feature | UDP | UDP-Lite | TCP | Multipath TCP | SCTP | DCCP | RUDP[a] |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Packet header size | 8 bytes | 8 bytes | 20–60 bytes | 50–90 bytes | 12 bytes[b] | 12 or 16 bytes | 14+ bytes |\n| Typical data-packet overhead | 8 bytes | 8 bytes | 20 bytes | ?? bytes | 44–48+ bytes[c] | 12 or 16 bytes | 14 bytes |\n| Transport-layer packet entity | Datagram | Datagram | Segment | Segment | Datagram | Datagram | Datagram |\n| Connection-oriented | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Reliable transport | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Unreliable transport | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Preserve message boundary | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Delivery | Unordered | Unordered | Ordered | Ordered | Ordered / Unordered | Unordered | Unordered |\n| Data checksum | Optional[d] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Optional |\n| Checksum size | 16 bits | 16 bits | 16 bits | 16 bits | 32 bits | 16 bits | 16 bits |\n| Partial checksum | No | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | No |\n| Path MTU | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | ? |\n| Flow control | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Congestion control | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | ? |\n| Explicit Congestion Notification | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | ? |\n| Multiple streams | No | No | No | No | Yes | No | No |\n| Multi-homing | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |\n| Bundling / Nagle | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | ? |\n- ^ RUDP is not officially standardized.

Class 0 contains no error recovery and was designed for use on network layers that provide error-free connections. Class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the session layer. All OSI connection-mode protocol classes provide expedited data and preservation of record boundaries. Detailed characteristics of the classes are shown in the following table:[11]\n| Service | TP0 | TP1 | TP2 | TP3 | TP4 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Connection-oriented network | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Connectionless network | No | No | No | No | Yes |\n| Concatenation and separation | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Segmentation and reassembly | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Error recovery | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\n| Reinitiate connection (if an excessive number of PDUs are unacknowledged) | No | Yes | No | Yes | No |\n| Multiplexing and demultiplexing over a single virtual circuit | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Explicit flow control | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Retransmission on timeout | No | No | No | No | Yes |\n| Reliable Transport Service | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\nThere is also a connectionless transport protocol, specified by ISO/IEC 8602/ITU-T Recommendation X.234.[12]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b R.

Its designated successor, IPv6, uses 128 bits for the IP address, giving it a larger address space.[3][4][5] Although IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s, both IPv4 and IPv6 are still used side-by-side as of 2025[update].\nIP addresses are usually displayed in a human-readable notation, but systems may use them in various different computer number formats. CIDR notation can also be used to designate how much of the address should be treated as a routing prefix. For example, 192.0.2.1/24 indicates that 24 significant bits of the address are the prefix, with the remaining 8 bits used for host addressing. This is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask (in this case, 255.255.255.0).\nThe IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and the five regional Internet registries (RIRs). IANA assigns blocks of IP addresses to the RIRs, which are responsible for distributing them to local Internet registries in their region such as internet service providers (ISPs) and large institutions. Some addresses are reserved for private networks and are not globally unique.\nWithin a network, the network administrator assigns an IP address to each device. Such assignments may be on a static (fixed or permanent) or dynamic basis, depending on network practices and software features. Some jurisdictions consider IP addresses to be personal data.\nFunction\nAn IP address serves two principal functions: it identifies the host, or more specifically, its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus, the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as follows: \"A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there.\"[2] The header of each IP packet contains the IP address of the sending host and that of the destination host.\nIP versions\nTwo versions of the Internet Protocol are in common use on the Internet today. The original version of the Internet Protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4).\nBy the early 1990s, the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address space available for assignment to Internet service providers and end-user organizations prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand addressing capability on the Internet. The result was a redesign of the Internet Protocol which became eventually known as Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) in 1995.[3][4][5] IPv6 technology was in various testing stages until the mid-2000s when commercial production deployment commenced.\nToday, these two versions of the Internet Protocol are in simultaneous use. Among other technical changes, each version defines the format of addresses differently. Because of the historical prevalence of IPv4, the generic term IP address typically still refers to the addresses defined by IPv4. The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental Internet Stream Protocol in 1979 which, however, was never referred to as IPv5.\nVersions 1 to 9 were defined, but only 4 and 6 ever gained widespread use. Transmission Control Protocol (the protocol suite later referred to as TCP/IP) versions 1[6] and 2[7] were published in 1974 and 1977. Version 3[8] was defined in 1978, and version 3.1 is the first version in which TCP is separated from IP.[9][10] Version 6 is a synthesis of several suggested versions, version 6 Simple Internet Protocol, version 7 TP/IX: The Next Internet, version 8 P. Internet Protocol, and version 9 TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses (TUBA).[11][12]\nSubnetworks\nIP networks may be divided into subnetworks in both IPv4 and IPv6. For this purpose, an IP address is recognized as consisting of two parts: the network prefix in the high-order bits and the remaining bits called the rest field, host identifier, or interface identifier (IPv6), used for host numbering within a network.[1] The subnet mask or CIDR notation determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\nThe term subnet mask is only used within IPv4. Both IP versions however use the CIDR concept and notation. In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the routing prefix. For example, an IPv4 address and its subnet mask may be 192.0.2.1 and 255.255.255.0, respectively. The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet is 192.0.2.1/24, because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.\nIPv4 addresses\nAn IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the address space to 4294967296 (232) addresses. Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as private networks (≈18 million addresses) and multicast addressing (≈270 million addresses).\nIPv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation, consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 192.0.2.1. Each part represents a group of 8 bits (an octet) of the address.[13] In some cases of technical writing,[specify] IPv4 addresses may be presented in various hexadecimal, octal, or binary representations.\nSubnetting history\nIn the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol, the network number was always the highest order octet (most significant eight bits). Because this method allowed for only 256 networks, it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number. In 1981, the addressing specification was revised with the introduction of classful network architecture.[2]\nClassful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine-grained subnetwork design. The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address were defined as the class of the address. Three classes (A, B, and C) were defined for universal unicast addressing. Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address. Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes (B and C). The following table gives an overview of this now-obsolete system.\n| Class | Leading bits |\nSize of network number bit field |\nSize of rest bit field |\nNumber of networks |\nNumber of addresses per network |\nStart address | End address |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 8 | 24 | 128 (27) | 16777216 (224) | 0.0.0.0 | 127.255.255.255 |\n| B | 10 | 16 | 16 | 16384 (214) | 65536 (216) | 128.0.0.0 | 191.255.255.255 |\n| C | 110 | 24 | 8 | 2097152 (221) | 256 (28) | 192.0.0.0 | 223.255.255.255 |\nClassful network design served its purpose in the startup stage of the Internet, but it lacked scalability in the face of the rapid expansion of networking in the 1990s. The class system of the address space was replaced with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993.[citation needed] CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes. Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.\nPrivate addresses\nEarly network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be globally unique. However, it was found that this was not always necessary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved.\nComputers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via TCP/IP, need not have globally unique IP addresses. Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with network address translation (NAT), when needed.\nThree non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks are reserved.[14] These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry. Any user may use any of the reserved blocks. Typically, a network administrator will divide a block into subnets; for example, many home routers automatically use a default address range of 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.0.255 (192.168.0.0/24).\nReserved private IPv4 network ranges[14] Name CIDR block Address range Number of\naddressesClassful description 24-bit block 10.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 16777216 Single Class A 20-bit block 172.16.0.0/12 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 1048576 Contiguous range of 16 Class B blocks 16-bit block 192.168.0.0/16 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 65536 Contiguous range of 256 Class C blocks\nIPv6 addresses\nIn IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2128 (approximately 3.403×1038) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future.\nThe intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of routing tables in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization ratios will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.\nThe large number of IPv6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing. With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.\nAll modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for IPv6, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, voice over IP (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and some networking hardware.\nPrivate addresses\nJust as IPv4 reserves addresses for private networks, blocks of addresses are set aside in IPv6. In IPv6, these are referred to as unique local addresses (ULAs). The routing prefix fc00::/7 is reserved for this block,[15] which is divided into two /8 blocks with different implied policies. The addresses include a 40-bit pseudorandom number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.\nEarly practices used a different block for this purpose (fec0::), dubbed site-local addresses.[16] However, the definition of what constituted a site remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing. This address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems.[17]\nAddresses starting with fe80::, called link-local addresses, are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link. The addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface. This provides instant and automatic communication between all IPv6 hosts on a link. This feature is used in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the Neighbor Discovery Protocol.\nPrivate and link-local address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.\nIP address assignment\nIP addresses are assigned to a host either dynamically as they join the network, or persistently by configuration of the host hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a static IP address. In contrast, when a computer's IP address is assigned each time it restarts, this is known as using a dynamic IP address.\nDynamic IP addresses are assigned by network using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).[18] DHCP is the most frequently used technology for assigning addresses. It avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network. It also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time. Typically, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default in modern desktop operating systems.\nThe address assigned with DHCP is associated with a lease and usually has an expiration period. If the lease is not renewed by the host before expiry, the address may be assigned to another device. Some DHCP implementations attempt to reassign the same IP address to a host, based on its MAC address, each time it joins the network. A network administrator may configure DHCP by allocating specific IP addresses based on MAC address.\nDHCP is not the only technology used to assign IP addresses dynamically. Bootstrap Protocol is a similar protocol and predecessor to DHCP. Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the Point-to-Point Protocol.\nComputers and equipment used for the network infrastructure, such as routers and mail servers, are typically configured with static addressing.\nIn the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations, an operating system may assign a link-local address to a host using stateless address autoconfiguration.\nSticky dynamic IP address\nSticky is an informal term used to describe a dynamically assigned IP address that seldom changes.[19] IPv4 addresses, for example, are usually assigned with DHCP, and a DHCP service can use rules that maximize the chance of assigning the same address each time a client asks for an assignment. In IPv6, a prefix delegation can be handled similarly, to make changes as rare as feasible. In a typical home or small-office setup, a single router is the only device visible to an Internet service provider (ISP), and the ISP may try to provide a configuration that is as stable as feasible, i.e. sticky. On the local network of the home or business, a local DHCP server may be designed to provide sticky IPv4 configurations, and the ISP may provide a sticky IPv6 prefix delegation, giving clients the option to use sticky IPv6 addresses. Sticky should not be confused with static; sticky configurations have no guarantee of stability, while static configurations are used indefinitely and only changed deliberately.\nAddress autoconfiguration\nAddress block 169.254.0.0/16 is defined for the special use of link-local addressing for IPv4 networks.[20] In IPv6, every interface, whether using static or dynamic addresses, also receives a link-local address automatically in the block fe80::/10.[20] These addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, to which a host is connected. These addresses are not routable and, like private addresses, cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.\nWhen the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, Microsoft developed a protocol called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA), whose first public implementation appeared in Windows 98.[21] APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and became a de facto standard in the industry. In May 2005, the IETF defined a formal standard for it.[22]\nAddressing conflicts\nAn IP address conflict occurs when two devices on the same local physical or wireless network claim to have the same IP address. A second assignment of an address generally stops the IP functionality of one or both of the devices. Many modern operating systems notify the administrator of IP address conflicts.[23][24] When IP addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods, any of them may be at fault.[25][26][27][28][29] If one of the devices involved in the conflict is the default gateway access beyond the LAN for all devices on the LAN, all devices may be impaired.\nRouting\nIP addresses are classified into several classes of operational characteristics: unicast, multicast, anycast and broadcast addressing.\nUnicast addressing\nThe most common concept of an IP address is in unicast addressing, available in both IPv4 and IPv6. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address. Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.\nBroadcast addressing\nBroadcasting is an addressing technique available in IPv4 to address data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission operation as an all-hosts broadcast. All receivers capture the network packet. The address 255.255.255.255 is used for network broadcast. In addition, a more limited directed broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix. For example, the destination address used for directed broadcast to devices on the network 192.0.2.0/24 is 192.0.2.255.[30]\nIPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing and replaces it with multicast to the specially defined all-nodes multicast address.\nMulticast addressing\nA multicast address is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 (the former Class D addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.[31] IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix ff00::/8 for multicast. In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers (those that have joined the corresponding multicast group).\nAnycast addressing\nLike broadcast and multicast, anycast is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is closest in the network. Anycast addressing is a built-in feature of IPv6.[32][33] In IPv4, anycast addressing is implemented with Border Gateway Protocol using the shortest-path metric to choose destinations. Anycast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed DNS systems.\nGeolocation\nA host may use geolocation to deduce the geographic position of its communicating peer.[34][35] This is typically done by retrieving geolocation info about the IP address of the other node from a database.[36]\nPublic address\nA public IP address is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in private networks, such as those reserved by RFC 1918, or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for link-local addressing. Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet. In a home situation, a public IP address is the IP address assigned to the home's network by the ISP. In this case, it is also locally visible by logging into the router configuration.[37]\nMost public IP addresses change relatively often. Any type of IP address that changes is called a dynamic IP address. In home networks, the ISP usually assigns a dynamic IP. If an ISP gave a home network an unchanging address, it is more likely to be abused by customers who host websites from home, or by hackers who can try the same IP address over and over until they breach a network.[37]\nAddress translation\nMultiple client devices can appear to share an IP address, either because they are part of a shared web hosting service environment or because an IPv4 network address translator (NAT) or proxy server acts as an intermediary agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP address is masked from the server receiving a request. A common practice is to have a NAT mask many devices in a private network. Only the public interface(s) of the NAT needs to have an Internet-routable address.[38]\nThe NAT device maps different IP addresses on the private network to different TCP or UDP port numbers on the public network. In residential networks, NAT functions are usually implemented in a residential gateway. In this scenario, the computers connected to the router have private IP addresses and the router has a public address on its external interface to communicate on the Internet. The internal computers appear to share one public IP address.\nLaw\nIn March 2024, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that IP addresses were protected private information under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with police searches requiring a warrant in order to obtain them.[39] IP addresses are considered personal data by the European Commission and are protected by the General Data Protection Regulation.[40] In the USA, the California Consumer Privacy Act only protects IP addresses that link to any particular consumer or household; otherwise it is not private data and is not protected under American law.[41]\nDiagnostic tools\nComputer operating systems provide various diagnostic tools to examine network interfaces and address configuration. Microsoft Windows provides the command-line interface tools ipconfig[42] and netsh and users of Unix-like systems may use ifconfig, netstat, route, lanstat, fstat, and iproute2 utilities to accomplish the task.[43]\nSee also\nReferences\n- ^ a b J.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)", "title": "Router (computing) - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Router (computing)\nA router[a] is a computer and networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks, including internetworks such as the global Internet.[2][3][4]\nRouters perform the \"traffic directing\" functions on the Internet. A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks. When a data packet comes in on a line, the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. Data packets are forwarded from one router to another through an internetwork until it reaches its destination node.[5]\nThe most familiar type of IP routers are home and small office routers that forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet. More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large business or ISP networks to powerful core routers that forward data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet backbone.\nRouters can be built from standard computer parts but are mostly specialized purpose-built computers. Early routers used software-based forwarding, running on a CPU. More sophisticated devices use application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to increase performance or add advanced filtering and firewall functionality.\nHistory\n[edit]The concepts of a switching node using software and an interface computer were first proposed by Donald Davies in 1966 for the NPL network.[6][7][8] The same idea was conceived by Wesley Clark the following year for use in the ARPANET, which were named Interface Message Processors (IMPs).[9] The first interface computer was implemented at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom in early 1969, followed later that year by the IMPs at the University of California, Los Angeles, the Stanford Research Institute, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah School of Computing in the United States.[10][11][12][13] All were built with the Honeywell 516. These computers had fundamentally the same functionality as a router does today.\nThe idea for a router (called a gateway at the time) initially came about through an international group of computer networking researchers called the International Network Working Group (INWG).[14] These gateway devices were different from most previous packet switching schemes in two ways. First, they connected dissimilar kinds of networks, such as serial lines and local area networks. Second, they were connectionless devices, which had no role in assuring that traffic was delivered reliably, leaving that function entirely to the hosts.[15] This particular idea, the end-to-end principle, was contained in the work of Donald Davies.[16][17]\nThe concept was explored in practice by various groups, with the intention to produce a working system for internetworking. There were three notable contemporaneous programs. The first was an implementation directed by Louis Pouzin of the CYCLADES network, which was designed and developed during 1972-3.[18][19][20] The second was a program at Xerox PARC to explore new networking technologies, which produced the PARC Universal Packet system. Some time after early 1974, the first Xerox routers became operational. Due to corporate intellectual property concerns, it received little attention outside Xerox for years.[21][22] The third was a DARPA-initiated program, which began during 1973-4. This drew on the work of the other two programs,[23] expanded significantly, and went on to create the TCP/IP architecture in use today.[24][25] University College London (UCL) provided a gateway between British research groups and the ARPANET from 1973 until the late 1980s, latterly using SATNET.[26][27][28]\nThe first true IP router was developed by Ginny Travers at BBN, as part of that DARPA-initiated effort, during 1975–1976.[29][30] By the end of 1976, three PDP-11-based routers were in service in the experimental prototype Internet.[31] Mike Brecia, Ginny Travers, and Bob Hinden received the IEEE Internet Award for early IP routers in 2008.[32]\nThe first multiprotocol routers were independently created by staff researchers at MIT and Stanford in 1981 and both were also based on PDP-11s. Stanford's router program was led by William Yeager and MIT's by Noel Chiappa.[33][34][35][36] Virtually all networking now uses TCP/IP, but multiprotocol routers are still manufactured. They were important in the early stages of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than TCP/IP were in use. Modern routers that handle both IPv4 and IPv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than those that process AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, and Xerox protocols.\nFrom the mid-1970s and in the 1980s, general-purpose minicomputers served as routers. Modern high-speed routers are network processors or highly specialized computers with extra hardware acceleration added to speed both common routing functions, such as packet forwarding, and specialized functions such as IPsec encryption. There is substantial use of Linux and Unix software-based machines, running open source routing code, for research and other applications. The Cisco IOS operating system was independently designed. Major router operating systems, such as Junos and NX-OS, are extensively modified versions of Unix software.\nOperation\n[edit]When multiple routers are used in interconnected networks, the routers can exchange information about destination addresses using a routing protocol. Each router builds up a routing table, a list of routes, between two computer systems on the interconnected networks.[37][38]\nThe software that runs the router is composed of two functional processing units that operate simultaneously, called planes:[39]\n- Control plane: A router maintains a routing table that lists which route should be used to forward a data packet, and through which physical interface connection. It does this using internal pre-configured directives, called static routes, or by learning routes dynamically using a routing protocol. Static and dynamic routes are stored in the routing table. The control-plane logic then strips non-essential directives from the table and builds a forwarding information base (FIB) to be used by the forwarding plane.\n- Forwarding plane: This unit forwards the data packets between incoming and outgoing interface connections. It reads the header of each packet as it comes in, matches the destination to entries in the FIB supplied by the control plane, and directs the packet to the outgoing network specified in the FIB.\nApplications\n[edit]A router may have interfaces for multiple types of physical layer connections, such as copper cables, fiber optic, or wireless transmission. It can also support multiple network layer transmission standards. Each network interface is used to enable data packets to be forwarded from one transmission system to another. Routers may also be used to connect two or more logical groups of computer devices known as subnets, each with a unique network prefix.\nRouters may provide connectivity within enterprises, between enterprises and the Internet, or between internet service providers' (ISPs') networks, they are also responsible for directing data between different networks.[40] The largest routers (such as the Cisco CRS-1 or Juniper PTX) interconnect the various ISPs, or may be used in large enterprise networks.[41] Smaller routers usually provide connectivity for typical home and office networks.\nAll sizes of routers may be found inside enterprises.[42] The most powerful routers are usually found in ISPs, academic and research facilities. Large businesses may also need more powerful routers to cope with ever-increasing demands of intranet data traffic. A hierarchical internetworking model for interconnecting routers in large networks is in common use.[43] Some routers can connect to Data service units for T1 connections[44][45][46] via serial ports.[47][48]\nAccess, core and distribution\n[edit]The hierarchical internetworking model divides enterprise networks into three layers: core, distribution, and access.\nAccess routers, including small office/home office (SOHO) models, are located at home and customer sites such as branch offices that do not need hierarchical routing of their own. Typically, they are optimized for low cost. Some SOHO routers are capable of running alternative free Linux-based firmware like Tomato, OpenWrt, or DD-WRT.[49]\nDistribution routers aggregate traffic from multiple access routers. Distribution routers are often responsible for enforcing quality of service across a wide area network (WAN), so they may have considerable memory installed, multiple WAN interface connections, and substantial onboard data processing routines. They may also provide connectivity to groups of file servers or other external networks.[50]\nIn enterprises, a core router may provide a collapsed backbone interconnecting the distribution tier routers from multiple buildings of a campus, or large enterprise locations. They tend to be optimized for high bandwidth but lack some of the features of edge routers.[51]\nSecurity\n[edit]External networks must be carefully considered as part of the overall security strategy of the local network. A router may include a firewall, VPN handling, and other security functions, or they may be handled by separate devices. Routers also commonly perform network address translation, which restricts connections initiated from external connections but is not recognized as a security feature by all experts.[52] Some experts argue that open source routers are more secure and reliable than closed source routers because errors and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities are more likely to be discovered and addressed in an open-source environment.[53][54]\nRouting different networks\n[edit]Routers are also often distinguished on the basis of the network in which they operate. A router in a local area network (LAN) of a single organization is called an interior router. A router that is operated in the Internet backbone is described as exterior router. While a router that connects a LAN with the Internet or a wide area network (WAN) is called a border router, or gateway router.[55]\nInternet connectivity and internal use\n[edit]Routers intended for ISP and major enterprise connectivity usually exchange routing information using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). RFC 4098 defines the types of BGP routers according to their functions:[56]\n- Edge router or inter-AS border router: Placed at the edge of an ISP network, where the router is used to peer with the upstream IP transit providers, bilateral peers through IXP, private peering (or even settlement-free peering) through Private Network Interconnect (PNI) via the extensive use of Exterior Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP).[57]\n- Provider Router (P): A Provider router is also called a transit-router, it sits in an MPLS network and is responsible for establishing label-switched paths between the PE routers.[58]\n- Provider edge router (PE): An MPLS-specific router in the network's access layer that interconnects with customer edge routers to provide layer 2 or layer 3 VPN services.[58]\n- Customer edge router (CE): Located at the edge of the subscriber's network, it interconnects with the PE router for L2VPN services, or direct layer 3 IP hand-off in the case of Dedicated Internet Access, if IP Transit services are provided through an MPLS core, the CE peers with the PE using eBGP with the public ASNs of each respective network. In the case of L3VPN services, the CE can exchange routes with the PE using eBGP. It is commonly used in both service provider and enterprise or data center organizations.[58]\n- Core router: Resides within an Autonomous System as a backbone to carry traffic between edge routers.[59]\n- Within an ISP: In the ISP's autonomous system, a router uses internal BGP to communicate with other ISP edge routers, other intranet core routers, or the ISP's intranet provider border routers.\n- Internet backbone: The Internet no longer has a clearly identifiable backbone, unlike its predecessor networks. See default-free zone (DFZ). The major ISPs' system routers make up what could be considered to be the current Internet backbone core.[60] ISPs operate all four types of the BGP routers described here. An ISP core router is used to interconnect its edge and border routers. Core routers may also have specialized functions in virtual private networks based on a combination of BGP and Multiprotocol Label Switching protocols.[61]\n- Port forwarding: In some networks that rely on legacy IPv4 and NAT, routers (often labeled as NAT boxes) are also used for port forwarding configuration between RFC 1918 address space and their publicly assigned IPv4 address.[42]\n- Voice, data, fax, and video processing routers: Commonly referred to as access servers or gateways, these devices are used to route and process voice, data, video and fax traffic on the Internet. Since 2005, most long-distance phone calls have been processed as IP traffic (VOIP) through a voice gateway. Use of access server-type routers expanded with the advent of the Internet, first with dial-up access and another resurgence with voice phone service.\n- Larger networks commonly use multilayer switches, with layer-3 devices being used to simply interconnect multiple subnets within the same security zone, and higher-layer switches when filtering, translation, load balancing, or other higher-level functions are required, especially between zones.\nWi-Fi routers\n[edit]Wi-Fi routers combine the functions of a router with those of a wireless access point. They are typically devices with a small form factor, operating on the standard electric power supply for residential use. Connected to the Internet as offered by an Internet service provider, they provide Internet access through a wireless network for home or office use.\nForwarding\n[edit]The main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for directly attached networks or more remote networks. A router is considered a layer-3 device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer-3 IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. When a router receives a packet, it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination IP address of the packet and one of the addresses in the routing table. Once a match is found, the packet is encapsulated in the layer-2 data link frame for the outgoing interface indicated in the table entry. A router typically does not look into the packet payload,[62] but only at the layer-3 addresses to make a forwarding decision, plus optionally other information in the header for hints on, for example, quality of service (QoS). For pure IP forwarding, a router is designed to minimize the state information associated with individual packets.[63] Once a packet is forwarded, the router does not retain any historical information about the packet.[b]\nThe routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a default or static routes that are configured manually, or dynamic entries from routing protocols where the router learns routes from other routers. A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; it is common – even necessary – in small networks, such as a home or small business, where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the Internet service provider. The default route can be manually configured (as a static route); learned by dynamic routing protocols; or be obtained by DHCP.[c][64]\nA router can run more than one routing protocol at a time, particularly if it serves as an autonomous system border router between parts of a network that run different routing protocols; if it does so, then redistribution may be used (usually selectively) to share information between the different protocols running on the same router.[65]\nBesides deciding to which interface a packet is forwarded, which is handled primarily via the routing table, a router also has to manage congestion when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process. Three policies commonly used are tail drop, random early detection (RED), and weighted random early detection (WRED). Tail drop is the simplest and most easily implemented: the router simply drops new incoming packets once buffer space in the router is exhausted. RED probabilistically drops datagrams early when the queue exceeds a pre-configured portion of the buffer, until reaching a pre-determined maximum, when it drops all incoming packets, thus reverting to tail drop. WRED can be configured to drop packets more readily depending on the type of traffic.\nAnother function a router performs is traffic classification and deciding which packet should be processed first. This is managed through QoS, which is critical when Voice over IP is deployed, so as not to introduce excessive latency.[66]\nYet another function a router performs is called policy-based routing, where special rules are constructed to override the rules derived from the routing table when a packet forwarding decision is made.[67]\nSome of the functions may be performed through an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to avoid the overhead of scheduling CPU time to process the packets. Others may have to be performed through the CPU as these packets need special attention that cannot be handled by an ASIC.[68]\nSee also\n[edit]Notes\n[edit]- ^ Pronounced /ˈruːtər/ in British English, /ˈraʊtər/ in American and Australian English.[1]\n- ^ In some router implementations, the forwarding action can increment a counter associated with the routing table entry for the collection of statistical data.\n- ^ A router can serve as a DHCP client or as a DHCP server.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"router\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation", "title": "Network address translation - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Network address translation\nNetwork address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.[1] The technique was initially used to bypass the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced but could not route the network's address space. It is a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.[2]\nAs network address translation modifies the IP address information in packets, NAT implementations may vary in their specific behavior in various addressing cases and their effect on network traffic. Vendors of equipment containing NAT implementations do not commonly document the specifics of NAT behavior.[2]\nHistory\n[edit]Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) uses 32-bit addresses, capable of uniquely addressing about 4.3 billion devices on the network. By 1992, it became evident that that would not be enough. The 1994 RFC 1631 describes NAT as a \"short-term solution\" to the two most compelling problems facing the Internet Protocol at that time: IP address depletion and scaling in routing. By 2004, NAT had become widespread.[3]\nThe technique also became known as IP masquerading. which suggests a technique that hides an entire IP address space, usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address in another, usually public address space. Because of the popularity of this technique to conserve IPv4 address space, the term NAT became virtually synonymous with IP masquerading.\nIn 1996, port-address translation (PAT) was introduced,[4] which expanded the translation of addresses to include port numbers.\nBasic NAT\n[edit]The simplest type of NAT provides a one-to-one translation of IP addresses (RFC 1631). RFC 2663 refers to this type of NAT as basic NAT, also called a one-to-one NAT. In this type of NAT, only the IP addresses, IP header checksum, and any higher-level checksums that include the IP address are changed. Basic NAT can be used to interconnect two IP networks with incompatible addresses.[2]\nOne-to-many NAT\n[edit]Most network address translators map multiple private hosts to one publicly exposed IP address.\nIn a typical configuration, a local network uses one of the designated private IP address subnets (RFC 1918[5]). The network has a router having network interfaces on both the private and the public network. The public address is typically assigned by an Internet service provider. As traffic passes from the private network to the Internet, NAT translates the source address in each packet from a private address to the router's public address. The NAT facility tracks each active connection. When the router receives inbound traffic from the Internet, it uses the connection tracking data obtained during the outbound phase to determine to which private address it should forward the reply.[2]\nPackets passing from the private network to the public network will have their source address modified, while packets passing from the public network back to the private network will have their destination address modified. To avoid ambiguity in how replies are translated, further modifications to the packets are required. The vast bulk of Internet traffic uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP). For these protocols, the port numbers are changed so that the combination of IP address (within the IP header) and port number (within the Transport Layer header) on the returned packet can be unambiguously mapped to the corresponding private network destination. RFC 2663 uses the term network address and port translation (NAPT) for this type of NAT.[5] Other names include port address translation (PAT), IP masquerading, NAT overload, and many-to-one NAT. This is the most common type of NAT and has become synonymous with the term NAT in common usage.\nThis method allows communication through the router only when the conversation originates in the private network, since the initial originating transmission establishes the required information in the translation tables. Thus, a web browser within the private network is able to browse websites that are outside the network, whereas web browsers outside the network are unable to browse a website hosted within.[a] Protocols not based on TCP and UDP require other translation techniques.\nThe primary benefit of one-to-many NAT is mitigation of IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing entire networks to be connected to the Internet using a single public IP address.\nMethods of translation\n[edit]Network address and port translation may be implemented in several ways. Some applications that use IP address information may need to determine the external address of a network address translator. This is the address that its communication peers in the external network detect. Furthermore, it may be necessary to examine and categorize the type of mapping in use, for example when it is desired to set up a direct communication path between two clients both of which are behind separate NAT gateways.\nFor this purpose, RFC 3489 specified the protocol Simple Traversal of UDP over NATs (STUN) in 2003. It classified NAT implementations as full-cone NAT, (address) restricted-cone NAT, port-restricted cone NAT or symmetric NAT, and proposed a methodology for testing a device accordingly. However, these procedures have since been deprecated from standards status, as the methods are inadequate to correctly assess many devices. RFC 5389 standardized new methods in 2008 and the acronym STUN since represents the new title of the specification: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT.\nEndpoint-Independent NAT, Full Cone NAT, 1:1/one-to-one NAT, or NAT 1\n|\n|\nAddress-Dependent NAT, Restricted Cone NAT, or NAT 2\n|\n|\nAddress- and Port-Dependent NAT, Port Restricted Cone NAT, or NAT 3\nIt is similar to an address restricted cone NAT, but the restriction includes port numbers. |\n|\nAddress- and Port-Dependent NAT, Symmetric NAT, or NAT 4\n|\nAs many NAT implementations combine multiple types, it is better to refer to specific individual NAT behavior instead of using the Cone/Symmetric terminology. RFC 4787 attempts to alleviate confusion by introducing standardized terminology for observed behaviors. For the first bullet in each row of the above table, the RFC would characterize Full-Cone, Restricted-Cone, and Port-Restricted-Cone NATs as having an Endpoint-Independent Mapping, whereas it would characterize a Symmetric NAT as having an Address- and Port-Dependent Mapping. For the second bullet in each row of the above table, RFC 4787 would also label Full-Cone NAT as having an Endpoint-Independent Filtering, Restricted-Cone NAT as having an Address-Dependent Filtering, Port-Restricted Cone NAT as having an Address- and Port-Dependent Filtering, and Symmetric NAT as having either an Address-Dependent Filtering or Address- and Port-Dependent Filtering. Other classifications of NAT behavior mentioned in the RFC include whether they preserve ports, when and how mappings are refreshed, whether external mappings can be used by internal hosts (i.e., its hairpinning behavior), and the level of determinism NATs exhibit when applying all these rules.[2] Specifically, most NATs combine symmetric NAT for outgoing connections with static port mapping, where incoming packets addressed to the external address and port are redirected to a specific internal address and port.\nNAT mapping vs NAT filtering\n[edit]RFC 4787 distinguishes between NAT mapping and NAT filtering.[2]\nSection 4.1 of the RFC covers NAT mapping and specifies the translation of an external IP address and port number into an internal IP address and port number. It defines endpoint-independent mapping, address-dependent mapping and address- and port-dependent mapping, explains that these three possible choices do not relate to the security of the NAT as security is determined by the filtering behavior and then specifies \"A NAT MUST have an 'Endpoint-Independent Mapping' behavior.\"\nSection 5 of the RFC covers NAT filtering and describes the criteria used by the NAT to filter packets originating from specific external endpoints. The options are endpoint-independent filtering, address-dependent filtering and address- and port-dependent filtering. Endpoint-independent filtering is recommended where maximum application transparency is required while address-dependent filtering is recommended where more stringent filtering behavior is most important.\nSome NAT devices are not compliant with RFC 4787 as they treat NAT mapping and filtering in the same way so that their configuration option for changing the NAT filtering method also changes the NAT mapping method (e.g. Netgate TNSR).\nType of NAT and NAT traversal, role of port preservation for TCP\n[edit]NAT traversal problems arise when peers behind different NATs try to communicate. One way to solve this problem is to use port forwarding. Another way is to use various NAT traversal techniques. The most popular technique for TCP NAT traversal is TCP hole punching.\nTCP hole punching requires the NAT to follow the port preservation design for TCP. For a given outgoing TCP communication, the same port numbers are used on both sides of the NAT. NAT port preservation for outgoing TCP connections is crucial for TCP NAT traversal because, under TCP, one port can only be used for one communication at a time. Programs that bind distinct TCP sockets to ephemeral ports for each TCP communication, make NAT port prediction impossible for TCP.[2]\nOn the other hand, for UDP, NATs do not need port preservation. Indeed, multiple UDP communications (each with a distinct endpoint) can occur on the same source port, and applications usually reuse the same UDP socket to send packets to distinct hosts. This makes port prediction straightforward, as it is the same source port for each packet.\nFurthermore, port preservation in NAT for TCP allows P2P protocols to offer less complexity and less latency because there is no need to use a third party (like STUN) to discover the NAT port since the application itself already knows the NAT port.[2][6]\nHowever, if two internal hosts attempt to communicate with the same external host using the same port number, the NAT may attempt to use a different external IP address for the second connection or may need to forgo port preservation and remap the port.[2]: 9 As of 2006[update], roughly 70% of the clients in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks employed some form of NAT.[7]\nImplementation\n[edit]Establishing two-way communication\n[edit]Every TCP and UDP packet contains a source port number and a destination port number. Each of those packets is encapsulated in an IP packet, whose IP header contains a source IP address and a destination IP address. The IP address/protocol/port number triple defines an association with a network socket.\nFor publicly accessible services such as web and mail servers the port number is important. For example, port 443 connects through a socket to the web server software and port 465 to a mail server's SMTP daemon.[8] The IP address of a public server is also important, similar in global uniqueness to a postal address or telephone number. Both IP address and port number must be correctly known by all hosts wishing to successfully communicate.\nPrivate IP addresses as described in RFC 1918 are usable only on private networks not directly connected to the internet. Ports are endpoints of communication unique to that host, so a connection through the NAT device is maintained by the combined mapping of port and IP address. A private address on the inside of the NAT is mapped to an external public address. Port address translation (PAT) resolves conflicts that arise when multiple hosts happen to use the same source port number to establish different external connections at the same time.\nTranslation process\n[edit]With NAT, all communications sent to external hosts actually contain the external IP address and port information of the NAT device instead of internal host IP addresses or port numbers. NAT only translates IP addresses and ports of its internal hosts, hiding the true endpoint of an internal host on a private network.\nWhen a computer on the private (internal) network sends an IP packet to the external network, the NAT device replaces the internal source IP address in the packet header with the external IP address of the NAT device. PAT may then assign the connection a port number from a pool of available ports,[b] inserting this port number in the source port field. The packet is then forwarded to the external network. The NAT device then makes an entry in a translation table containing the internal IP address, original source port, and the translated source port. Subsequent packets from the same internal source IP address and port number are translated to the same external source IP address and port number. The computer receiving a packet that has undergone NAT establishes a connection to the port and IP address specified in the altered packet, oblivious to the fact that the supplied address is being translated.\nUpon receiving a packet from the external network, the NAT device searches the translation table based on the destination port in the packet header. If a match is found, the destination IP address and port number is replaced with the values found in the table and the packet is forwarded to the inside network. Otherwise, if the destination port number of the incoming packet is not found in the translation table, the packet is dropped or rejected because the PAT device doesn't know where to send it.\nApplications\n[edit]- Routing\n- Network address translation can be used to mitigate IP address overlap.[9][10] Address overlap occurs when hosts in different networks with the same IP address space try to reach the same destination host. This is most often a misconfiguration and may result from the merger of two networks or subnets, especially when using RFC 1918 private network addressing. The destination host experiences traffic apparently arriving from the same network, and intermediate routers have no way to determine where reply traffic should be sent to. The solution is either renumbering to eliminate overlap or network address translation.\n- Load balancing\n- In client–server applications, load balancers forward client requests to a set of server computers to manage the workload of each server. Network address translation may be used to map a representative IP address of the server cluster to specific hosts that service the request.[11][12][13][14]\nRelated techniques\n[edit]IEEE Reverse Address and Port Translation (RAPT or RAT) allows a host whose real IP address changes from time to time to remain reachable as a server via a fixed home IP address.[15] Cisco's RAPT implementation is PAT or NAT overloading and maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address. Multiple addresses can be mapped to a single address because each private address is tracked by a port number. PAT uses unique source port numbers on the inside global IP address to distinguish between translations.[c] PAT attempts to preserve the original source port. If this source port is already used, PAT assigns the first available port number starting from the beginning of the appropriate port group 0–511, 512–1023, or 1024–65535. When there are no more ports available and there is more than one external IP address configured, PAT moves to the next IP address to try to allocate the original source port again. This process continues until it runs out of available ports and external IP addresses.\nMapping of Address and Port is a Cisco proposal that combines Address plus Port translation with tunneling of the IPv4 packets over an ISP provider's internal IPv6 network. In effect, it is an (almost) stateless alternative to carrier-grade NAT and DS-Lite that pushes the IPv4 address/port translation function (and the maintenance of NAT state) entirely into the existing customer premises equipment NAT implementation. Thus avoiding the NAT444 and statefulness problems of carrier-grade NAT, and also provides a transition mechanism for the deployment of native IPv6 at the same time with very little added complexity.\nIssues and limitations\n[edit]Hosts behind NAT-enabled routers do not have end-to-end connectivity and cannot participate in some internet protocols. Services that require the initiation of TCP connections from the outside network, or that use stateless protocols such as those using UDP, can be disrupted. Unless the NAT router makes a specific effort to support such protocols, incoming packets cannot reach their destination. Some protocols can accommodate one instance of NAT between participating hosts (\"passive mode\" FTP, for example), sometimes with the assistance of an application-level gateway (see § Applications affected by NAT), but fail when both systems are separated from the internet by NAT. The use of NAT also complicates tunneling protocols such as IPsec because NAT modifies values in the headers which interfere with the integrity checks done by IPsec and other tunneling protocols.\nEnd-to-end connectivity has been a core principle of the Internet, supported, for example, by the Internet Architecture Board. Current Internet architectural documents observe that NAT is a violation of the end-to-end principle, but that NAT does have a valid role in careful design.[16] There is considerably more concern with the use of IPv6 NAT, and many IPv6 architects believe IPv6 was intended to remove the need for NAT.[17]\nAn implementation that only tracks ports can be quickly depleted by internal applications that use multiple simultaneous connections such as an HTTP request for a web page with many embedded objects. This problem can be mitigated by tracking the destination IP address in addition to the port thus sharing a single local port with many remote hosts. This additional tracking increases implementation complexity and computing resources at the translation device.\nBecause the internal addresses are all disguised behind one publicly accessible address, it is impossible for external hosts to directly initiate a connection to a particular internal host. Applications such as VOIP, videoconferencing, and other peer-to-peer applications must use NAT traversal techniques to function.\nFragmentation and checksums\n[edit]Pure NAT, operating on IP alone, may or may not correctly parse protocols with payloads containing information about IP, such as ICMP. This depends on whether the payload is interpreted by a host on the inside or outside of the translation. Basic protocols such as TCP and UDP cannot function properly unless NAT takes action beyond the network layer.\nIP packets have a checksum in each packet header, which provides error detection only for the header. IP datagrams may become fragmented and it is necessary for a NAT to reassemble these fragments to allow correct recalculation of higher-level checksums and correct tracking of which packets belong to which connection.\nTCP and UDP have a checksum that covers all the data they carry, as well as the TCP or UDP header, plus a pseudo-header that contains the source and destination IP addresses of the packet carrying the TCP or UDP header. For an originating NAT to pass TCP or UDP successfully, it must recompute the TCP or UDP header checksum based on the translated IP addresses, not the original ones, and put that checksum into the TCP or UDP header of the first packet of the fragmented set of packets.\nAlternatively, the originating host may perform path MTU Discovery to determine the packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation and then set the don't fragment (DF) bit in the appropriate packet header field. This is only a one-way solution, because the responding host can send packets of any size, which may be fragmented before reaching the NAT.\nVariant terms\n[edit]DNAT\n[edit]Destination network address translation (DNAT) is a technique for transparently changing the destination IP address of a routed packet and performing the inverse function for any replies. Any router situated between two endpoints can perform this transformation of the packet.\nDNAT is commonly used to publish a service located in a private network on a publicly accessible IP address. This use of DNAT is also called port forwarding, or DMZ when used on an entire server, which becomes exposed to the WAN, becoming analogous to an undefended military demilitarized zone (DMZ).\nSNAT\n[edit]The meaning of the term SNAT varies by vendor:[18][19][20]\n- source NAT is a common expansion and is the counterpart of destination NAT (DNAT). This is used to describe one-to-many NAT; NAT for outgoing connections to public services.\n- stateful NAT is used by Cisco Systems[21]\n- static NAT is used by WatchGuard[22]\n- secure NAT is used by F5[23] and by Microsoft (in regard to the ISA Server)\nSecure network address translation (SNAT) is part of Microsoft's Internet Security and Acceleration Server and is an extension to the NAT driver built into Microsoft Windows Server. It provides connection tracking and filtering for the additional network connections needed for the FTP, ICMP, H.323, and PPTP protocols as well as the ability to configure a transparent HTTP proxy server.\nDynamic network address translation\n[edit]Dynamic NAT, just like static NAT, is not common in smaller networks but is found within larger corporations with complex networks. Where static NAT provides a one-to-one internal to public static IP address mapping, dynamic NAT uses a group of public IP addresses.[24][25]\nNAT hairpinning\n[edit]NAT hairpinning, also known as NAT loopback or NAT reflection,[26] is a feature in many consumer routers[27] where a machine on the LAN is able to access another machine on the LAN via the external IP address of the LAN/router (with port forwarding set up on the router to direct requests to the appropriate machine on the LAN). This notion is officially described in 2008, RFC 5128.\nThe following describes an example network:\n- Public address: 203.0.113.1. This is the address of the WAN interface on the router.\n- Internal address of router: 192.168.1.1\n- Address of the server: 192.168.1.2\n- Address of a local computer: 192.168.1.100\nIf a packet is sent to 203.0.113.1 by a computer at 192.168.1.100, the packet would normally be routed to the default gateway (the router)[d]. A router with the NAT loopback feature detects that 203.0.113.1 is the address of its WAN interface, and treats the packet as if coming from that interface. It determines the destination for that packet, based on DNAT (port forwarding) rules for the destination. If the data were sent to port 80 and a DNAT rule exists for port 80 directed to 192.168.1.2, then the host at that address receives the packet.\nIf no applicable DNAT rule is available, the router drops the packet. An ICMP Destination Unreachable reply may be sent. If any DNAT rules were present, address translation is still in effect; the router still rewrites the source IP address in the packet. The local computer (192.168.1.100) sends the packet as coming from 192.168.1.100, but the server (192.168.1.2) receives it as coming from 203.0.113.1. When the server replies, the process is identical to an external sender. Thus, two-way communication is possible between hosts inside the LAN network via the public IP address.\nNAT in IPv6\n[edit]Network address translation is not commonly used in IPv6 because one of the design goals of IPv6 is to restore end-to-end network connectivity.[28] The large addressing space of IPv6 obviates the need to conserve addresses and every device can be given a unique globally routable address. Use of unique local addresses in combination with network prefix translation can achieve results similar to NAT.\nThe large addressing space of IPv6 can still be defeated depending on the actual prefix length given by the carrier. It is not uncommon to be handed a /64 prefix – the smallest recommended subnet – for an entire home network, requiring a variety of techniques to be used to manually subdivide the range for all devices to remain reachable.[29] Even actual IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT, NAT66, can turn out useful at times: the APNIC blog outlines a case where the author was only provided a single address (/128).[30]\nApplications affected by NAT\n[edit]Some application layer protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), send explicit network addresses within their application data. File Transfer Protocol in active mode, for example, uses separate connections for control traffic (commands) and for data traffic (file contents). When requesting a file transfer, the host making the request identifies the corresponding data connection by its network layer and transport layer addresses. If the host making the request lies behind a simple NAT firewall, the translation of the IP address or TCP port number makes the information received by the server invalid. SIP commonly controls voice over IP calls, and suffer the same problem. SIP and its accompanying Session Description Protocol may use multiple ports to set up a connection and transmit voice stream via Real-time Transport Protocol. IP addresses and port numbers are encoded in the payload data and must be known before the traversal of NATs. Without special techniques, such as STUN, NAT behavior is unpredictable and communications may fail. Application Layer Gateway (ALG) software or hardware may correct these problems. An ALG software module running on a NAT firewall device updates any payload data made invalid by address translation. ALGs need to understand the higher-layer protocol that they need to fix, and so each protocol with this problem requires a separate ALG. For example, on many Linux systems, there are kernel modules called connection trackers that serve to implement ALGs. However, ALG cannot work if the protocol data is encrypted.\nAnother possible solution to this problem is to use NAT traversal techniques using protocols such as STUN or Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), or proprietary approaches in a session border controller. NAT traversal is possible in both TCP- and UDP-based applications, but the UDP-based technique is simpler, more widely understood, and more compatible with legacy NATs.[citation needed] In either case, the high-level protocol must be designed with NAT traversal in mind, and it does not work reliably across symmetric NATs or other poorly behaved legacy NATs.\nOther possibilities are Port Control Protocol (PCP),[31] NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP), or Internet Gateway Device Protocol but these require the NAT device to implement that protocol.\nMost client–server protocols (FTP being the main exception[e]), however, do not send layer 3 contact information and do not require any special treatment by NATs. In fact, avoiding NAT complications is practically a requirement when designing new higher-layer protocols today.\nNATs can also cause problems where IPsec encryption is applied and in cases where multiple devices such as SIP phones are located behind a NAT. Phones that encrypt their signaling with IPsec encapsulate the port information within an encrypted packet, meaning that NAT devices cannot access and translate the port. In these cases, the NAT devices revert to simple NAT operations. This means that all traffic returning to the NAT is mapped onto one client, causing service to more than one client behind the NAT to fail. There are a couple of solutions to this problem: one is to use TLS, which operates at layer 4 and does not mask the port number; another is to encapsulate the IPsec within UDP – the latter being the solution chosen by TISPAN to achieve secure NAT traversal, or a NAT with \"IPsec Passthru\" support; another is to use a session border controller to help traverse the NAT.\nInteractive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a NAT traversal technique that does not rely on ALG support.\nThe DNS protocol vulnerability announced by Dan Kaminsky on July 8, 2008,[32] is indirectly affected by NAT port mapping. To avoid DNS cache poisoning, it is highly desirable not to translate UDP source port numbers of outgoing DNS requests from a DNS server behind a firewall that implements NAT. The recommended workaround for the DNS vulnerability is to make all caching DNS servers use randomized UDP source ports. If the NAT function de-randomizes the UDP source ports, the DNS server becomes vulnerable.\nExamples of NAT software\n[edit]- Internet Connection Sharing (ICS): NAT & DHCP implementation included with Windows desktop operating systems\n- IPFilter: included with (OpenSolaris, FreeBSD and NetBSD, available for many other Unix-like operating systems\n- ipfirewall (ipfw): FreeBSD-native packet filter\n- Netfilter with iptables/nftables: the Linux packet filter\n- NPF: NetBSD-native packet filter\n- PF: OpenBSD-native packet filter\n- Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS): routing implementation included with Windows Server operating systems\n- VPP: user space packet forwarding implementation for Linux\n- WinGate: third-party routing implementation for Windows\nSee also\n[edit]- Anything In Anything (AYIYA) – IPv6 over IPv4 UDP, thus working IPv6 tunneling over most NATs\n- Carrier-grade NAT – NAT behind NAT within an ISP\n- Gateway (telecommunications) – Connection between two network systems\n- Internet Gateway Device Protocol (UPnP IGD) NAT-traversal method\n- Middlebox – Intermediary box on the data path between a source host and destination host\n- NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) NAT-traversal method\n- Port Control Protocol (PCP) NAT-traversal method\n- Port triggering – NAT traversal mechanism\n- Subnetwork – Logical subdivision of an IP network\n- Teredo tunneling – NAT traversal using IPv6\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ Most NAT devices today allow the network administrator to configure static translation table entries for connections from the external network to the internal masqueraded network. This feature is often referred to as static NAT. It may be implemented in two types: port forwarding which forwards traffic from a specific external port to an internal host on a specified port, and designation of a DMZ host which passes all traffic received on the external interface (on any port number) to an internal IP address while preserving the destination port. Both types may be available in the same NAT device.\n- ^ As the NAT router allocates an individual port for each outgoing connection, a huge number of outgoing connections may saturate the range of available ports. As ports typically get freed when the connection doesn't produce any more traffic for a certain time, the maximum number of active connections is limited to approximately 64K.\n- ^ The port numbers are 16-bit integers. The total number of internal addresses that can be translated to one external address could theoretically be as high as 65,536 per IP address. Realistically, the number of ports that can be assigned a single IP address is around 4000.\n- ^ Unless an explicit route is set in the computer's routing tables.\n- ^ This issue can be avoided by using SFTP instead of FTP\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Network Protocols Handbook (2 ed.).

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)", "title": "Firewall (computing) - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Firewall (computing)\nIn computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on configurable security rules.[1][2] A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet[3] or between several VLANs. Firewalls can be categorized as network-based or host-based.\nHistory\n[edit]The term firewall originally referred to a wall to confine a fire within a line of adjacent buildings.[4] Later uses refer to similar structures, such as the metal sheet separating the engine compartment of a vehicle or aircraft from the passenger compartment. The term was applied in the 1980s to network technology[5] that emerged when the Internet was fairly new in terms of its global use and connectivity.[6] The predecessors to firewalls for network security were routers used in the 1980s. Because they already segregated networks, routers could filter packets crossing them.[7]\nBefore it was used in real-life computing, the term appeared in John Badham's 1983 computer‑hacking movie WarGames, spoken by the bearded and bespectacled programmer named Paul Richter, which possibly inspired its later use.[8]\nOne of the earliest commercially successful firewall and network address translation (NAT) products was the PIX (Private Internet eXchange) Firewall, invented in 1994 by Network Translation Inc., a startup founded and run by John Mayes. The PIX Firewall technology was coded by Brantley Coile as a consultant software developer.[9] Recognizing the emerging IPv4 address depletion problem, they designed the PIX to enable organizations to securely connect private networks to the public internet using a limited number of registered IP addresses. The innovative PIX solution quickly gained industry acclaim, earning the prestigious \"Hot Product of the Year\" award from Data Communications Magazine in January 1995. Cisco Systems, seeking to expand into the rapidly growing network security market, subsequently acquired Network Translation Inc. in November 1995 to obtain the rights to the PIX technology. The PIX became one of Cisco's flagship firewall product lines before eventually being succeeded by the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) platform introduced in 2005.\nTypes of firewalls\n[edit]Firewalls are categorized as a network-based or a host-based system. Network-based firewalls are positioned between two or more networks, typically between the local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN),[10] their basic function being to control the flow of data between connected networks. They are either a software appliance running on general-purpose hardware, a hardware appliance running on special-purpose hardware, or a virtual appliance running on a virtual host controlled by a hypervisor. Firewall appliances may also offer non-firewall functionality, such as DHCP[11][12] or VPN[13] services. Host-based firewalls are deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources.[14][15] This can be a daemon or service as a part of the operating system or an agent application for protection.\nPacket filter\n[edit]The first reported type of network firewall is called a packet filter which inspects packets transferred between computers. The firewall maintains an access-control list which dictates what packets will be looked at and what action should be applied, if any, with the default action set to silent discard. Three basic actions regarding the packet consist of a silent discard, discard with Internet Control Message Protocol or TCP reset response to the sender, and forward to the next hop.[16] Packets may be filtered by source and destination IP addresses, protocol, or source and destination ports. The bulk of Internet communication in 20th and early 21st century used either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in conjunction with well-known ports, enabling firewalls of that era to distinguish between specific types of traffic such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, and file transfers.[17][18]\nThe first paper published on firewall technology was in 1987 when engineers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) developed filter systems known as packet filter firewalls. At AT&T Bell Labs, Bill Cheswick and Steve Bellovin continued their research in packet filtering and developed a working model for their own company based on their original first-generation architecture.[19] In 1992, Steven McCanne and Van Jacobson released a paper on BSD Packet Filter (BPF) while at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.[20][21]\nConnection tracking\n[edit]From 1989–1990, three colleagues from AT&T Bell Laboratories, Dave Presotto, Janardan Sharma, and Kshitij Nigam, developed the second generation of firewalls, calling them circuit-level gateways.[22]\nSecond-generation firewalls perform the work of their first-generation predecessors but also maintain knowledge of specific conversations between endpoints by remembering which port number the two IP addresses are using at layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model for their conversation, allowing examination of the overall exchange between the nodes.[23]\nApplication layer\n[edit]Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, and Peter Churchyard released an application firewall known as Firewall Toolkit (FWTK) in October 1993.[24] This became the basis for Gauntlet firewall at Trusted Information Systems.[25][26]\nThe key benefit of application layer filtering is that it can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows it to identify unwanted applications or services using a non standard port, or detect if an allowed protocol is being abused.[27] It can also provide unified security management including enforced encrypted DNS and virtual private networking.[28][29][30]\nAs of 2012, the next-generation firewall provides a wider range of inspection at the application layer, extending deep packet inspection functionality to include, but is not limited to:\n- Web filtering\n- Intrusion prevention systems\n- User identity management\n- Web application firewall\n- Content inspection and heuristic analysis[31]\n- TLS Inspection\nEndpoint specific\n[edit]Endpoint-based application firewalls function by determining whether a process should accept any given connection. Application firewalls filter connections by examining the process ID of data packets against a rule set for the local process involved in the data transmission. Application firewalls accomplish their function by hooking into socket calls to filter the connections between the application layer and the lower layers. Application firewalls that hook into socket calls are also referred to as socket filters.[citation needed]\nFirewall Policies\n[edit]At the core of a firewall's operation are the policies that govern its decision-making process. These policies, collectively known as firewall rules, are the specific guidelines that determine the traffic allowed or blocked across a network's boundaries.[32][33]\nFirewall rules are based on the evaluation of network packets against predetermined security criteria. A network packet, which carries data across networks, must match certain attributes defined in a rule to be allowed through the firewall. These attributes commonly include:\n- Direction: Inbound or outbound traffic\n- Source: Where the traffic originates (IP address, range, network, or zone)\n- Destination: Where the traffic is headed (IP address, range, network, or zone)\n- Port: Network ports specific to various services (e.g., port 80 for HTTP)\n- Protocol: The type of network protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)\n- Applications: L7 inspection or grouping av services.\n- Action: Whether to allow, deny, drop, or require further inspection for the traffic\nZones\n[edit]Zones are logical segments within a network that group together devices with similar security requirements. By partitioning a network into zones, such as \"Technical\", \"WAN\", \"LAN\", \"Public,\" \"Private,\" \"DMZ\", and \"Wireless,\" administrators can enforce policies that control the flow of traffic between them. Each zone has its own level of trust and is governed by specific firewall rules that regulate the ingress and egress of data.\nA typical default is to allow all traffic from LAN to WAN, and to drop all traffic from WAN to LAN.\nServices\n[edit]In networking terms, services are specific functions typically identified by a network port and protocol. Common examples include HTTP/HTTPS (web traffic) on ports 80 and 443, FTP (file transfer) on port 21, and SMTP (email) on port 25. Services are the engines behind the applications users depend on. From a security aspect, controlling access to services is crucial because services are common targets for exploitation. Firewalls employ rules that stipulate which services should be accessible, to whom, and in what context. For example, a firewall might be configured to block incoming FTP requests to prevent unauthorized file uploads but allow outgoing HTTPS requests for web browsing.\nApplications\n[edit]Applications refer to the software systems that users interact with while on the network. They can range from web browsers and email clients to complex database systems and cloud-based services. In network security, applications are important because different types of traffic can pose varying security risks. Thus, firewall rules can be crafted to identify and control traffic based on the application generating or receiving it. By using application awareness, firewalls can allow, deny, or limit traffic for specific applications according to organizational policies and compliance requirements, thereby mitigating potential threats from vulnerable or undesired applications.\nApplication can both be a grouping of services, or a L7 inspection.\nUSER ID\n[edit]Implementing firewall rules based on IP addresses alone is often insufficient due to the dynamic nature of user location and device usage.[33][34] User ID will be translated to an IP address.\nThis is where the concept of \"User ID\" makes a significant impact. User ID allows firewall rules to be crafted based on individual user identities, rather than just fixed source or destination IP addresses. This enhances security by enabling more granular control over who can access certain network resources, regardless of where they are connecting from or what device they are using.\nThe User ID technology is typically integrated into firewall systems through the use of directory services such as Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS or TACACS+. These services link the user's login information to their network activities. By doing this, the firewall can apply rules and policies that correspond to user groups, roles, or individual user accounts instead of purely relying on the network topology.\nExample of Using User ID in Firewall Rules\n[edit]Consider a school that wants to restrict access to a social media server from students. They can create a rule in the firewall that utilises User ID information to enforce this policy.\n- Directory Service Configuration — First, the firewall must be configured to communicate with the directory service that stores user group memberships. In this case, an Active Directory server.\n- User Identification — The firewall maps network traffic to specific user IDs by interpreting authentication logs. When a user logs on, the firewall associates that login with the user's IP address.\n- Define User Groups — Within the firewall's management interface, define user groups based on the directory service. For example, create groups such as \"Students\".\n- Create Firewall Rule:\n- Source: User ID (e.g., Students)\n- Destination: list of IP addresses\n- Service/Application: Allowed services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS)\n- Action: Deny\n- Implement Default Allow Rule:\nWith this setup, only users who authenticate and are identified as members of \"Students\" are denied to access social media servers. All other traffic, starting from LAN interfaces, will be allowed.\nConfiguration\n[edit]Setting up a firewall is a complex and error-prone task. A network may face security issues due to configuration errors.[35]\nFirewall policies are typically configured according to the type of network in use, such as public or private environments. Administrators define rules that permit or restrict traffic in order to reduce exposure to threats like unauthorized access, malware, or other forms of cyberattack.[36]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Boudriga, Noureddine (2010).

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "title": "Virtual private network - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Virtual private network\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. (September 2025) |\nA virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network that uses network virtualization to extend a private network across a public network, such as the Internet, via the use of encryption and tunneling protocols.[1] In a VPN, a tunneling protocol is used to transfer network messages from one network host to another.\nHost-to-network VPNs are commonly used by organisations to allow off-site users secure access to an office network over the Internet.[2][3] Site-to-site VPNs connect two networks, such as an office network and a datacenter. Provider-provisioned VPNs isolate parts of the provider's own network infrastructure in virtual segments, in ways that make the contents of each segment private with respect to the others. Individuals also use VPNs to encrypt and anonymize their network traffic, with VPN services selling access to their own private networks.\nVPNs can enhance usage privacy by making an ISP unable to access the private data exchanged across the VPN. Through encryption, VPNs enhance confidentiality and reduce the risk of successful data sniffing attacks.\nBackground\n[edit]A network is a group of communicating computers known as hosts, which communicate data to other hosts via communication protocols, as facilitated by networking hardware. Within a computer network, computers are identified by network addresses, which allow rule-based systems such as Internet Protocol to locate and identify hosts. Hosts may also have hostnames, memorable labels for the host nodes, which are rarely changed after initial assignment. The transmission medium that supports information exchange includes wired media like copper cables, optical fibers, and wireless radio-frequency media. The arrangement of hosts and hardware within a network architecture is known as the network topology.[4][5]\nApart from physical transmission media, networks comprise network nodes such as network interface controllers, repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, and modems:\n- The network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media. In Ethernet networks, each NIC has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address, usually stored in the controller's permanent memory.\n- A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation.\n- An Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.\n- Unlike hubs, which forward communication to all ports, network switches forward frames only to the ports involved in the communication. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional switches. Network bridges are analogous to a two-port switch.\n- Bridges and switches operate at the data link layer of the OSI model and bridge traffic between two or more network segments to form a single local network. Both are devices that forward frames of data between ports based on the destination MAC address in each frame. Network segmentation through bridging and switching helps break down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n- A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet.\n- Modems (modulator-demodulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless.\nNetwork communication\n[edit]A communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. Communication protocols have various characteristics, such as being connection-oriented or connectionless, or using circuit switching or packet switching.\nIn a protocol stack, often constructed per the OSI model, communications functions are divided into protocol layers, where each layer leverages the services of the layer below it until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is HTTP, the World Wide Web protocol. HTTP runs over TCP over IP, the Internet protocols, which in turn run over IEEE 802.11, the Wi-Fi protocol. This stack is used between a wireless router and a personal computer when accessing the web.\nMost modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.\nThe Internet protocol suite, also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking and the defining set of protocols for the Internet. It offers connection-less and connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission using Internet protocol (IP). At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.[6]\nSecurity\n[edit]VPNs do not make connected users anonymous or unidentifiable to the untrusted medium network provider, such as an internet service provider (ISP). However, VPNs can enhance usage privacy by making an ISP unable to access the private data exchanged across the VPN. Through encryption, VPNs enhance confidentiality and reduce the risk of successful data sniffing attacks. Data packets travelling across a VPN may also be secured by tamper proofing via a message authentication code, prevents the message from being altered or tampered without being rejected, enhancing data integrity.[citation needed]\nA number of other implementations exist to ensure authentication of connecting parties. Tunnel endpoints can be authenticated in various ways during the VPN access initiation, such as by the whitelisting of endpoint IP address. Authentication may also occur after actual tunnels are already active, for example, with a web captive portal. Remote-access VPNs may also use passwords, biometrics, two-factor authentication, or other cryptographic methods. Site-to-site VPNs often use passwords (pre-shared keys) or digital certificates.[citation needed]\nSplit tunneling\n[edit]Split tunneling allows a user to access distinct security domains at the same time, using the same or different network connections.[7] This connection state is usually facilitated through the simultaneous use of a LAN network interface controller (NIC), radio NIC, Wireless LAN NIC, and virtual private network client software application. Split tunneling is most commonly configured via the use of a remote-access VPN client, which allows the user to simultaneously connect to a nearby wireless network, resources on an off-site corporate network, as well as websites over the internet.\nNot every VPN allows split tunneling.[8][9][10] Advantages of split tunneling include alleviating bottlenecks, conserving bandwidth (as internet traffic does not have to pass through the VPN server), and enabling a user to not have to continually connect and disconnect when remotely accessing resources..[citation needed] Disadvantages include DNS leaks and potentially bypassing gateway-level security that might be in place within the company infrastructure.[11] Internet service providers often use split tunneling to that implement for DNS hijacking purposes.\nClassification\n[edit]Topology\n[edit]A host-to-network configuration is analogous to joining one or more computers to a network to which they cannot be directly connected. This type of extension provides computer access to a local area network of a remote site, or any wider enterprise networks, such as an intranet. Each computer is in charge of activating its own tunnel towards the network it wants to join. The joined network is only aware of a single remote host for each tunnel. This may be employed for remote workers, or to enable people accessing their private home or company resources without exposing them on the public Internet. [citation needed]\nA site-to-site configuration connects two networks. This configuration expands a network across geographically disparate locations. Tunneling is only done between gateway devices located at each network location. These devices then make the tunnel available to other local network hosts that aim to reach any host on the other side. This is useful to keep sites connected to each other in a stable manner, like office networks to their headquarters or datacenter. In this case, any side may be configured to initiate the communication as long as it knows how to reach the other. In the context of site-to-site configurations, the terms intranet and extranet are used to describe two different use cases.[12] An intranet site-to-site VPN describes a configuration where the sites connected by the VPN belong to the same organization, whereas an extranet site-to-site VPN joins sites belonging to multiple organizations.[citation needed]\nA limitation of traditional VPNs is that they are point-to-point connections and do not tend to support broadcast domains. Therefore, communication, software, and networking that are based on layer 2 and broadcast packets (such as NetBIOS used in Windows networking) may not be fully supported as on a local area network. Variants on VPN such as Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and layer 2 tunneling protocols are designed to overcome this limitation.[13]\nTrusted and secure delivery networks\n[edit]Trusted VPNs do not use cryptographic tunneling; instead, they rely on the security of a single provider's network to protect the traffic.[14] Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) often overlays trusted VPNs, often with quality-of-service control over a trusted delivery network. A secure VPN either trusts the underlying delivery network or enforces security with an internal mechanism. Unless the trusted delivery network runs among physically secure sites only, both trusted and secure models need an authentication mechanism for users to gain access to the VPN.[citation needed]\nTypes\n[edit]Mobile VPN\n[edit]Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points without dropping the secure VPN session or losing application sessions.[15] Mobile VPNs are widely used in public safety where they give law-enforcement officers access to applications such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases,[16] and in other organizations with similar requirements such as field service management and healthcare.[17][need quotation to verify]\nDMVPN\n[edit]Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network (DMVPN)[18] is a dynamic tunneling form of a virtual private network supported on Cisco IOS-based routers, Huawei AR G3 routers,[19] and Unix-like operating systems.\nDMVPN provides the capability for creating a dynamic-mesh VPN network without having to statically pre-configure all possible tunnel end-point peers, such as IPsec and ISAKMP peers.[20] DMVPN is initially configured to build a hub-and-spoke network by statically configuring the hubs (VPN headends) on the spokes; no change in the configuration on the hub is required to accept new spokes. Using this initial hub-and-spoke network, tunnels between spokes are dynamically built on demand without additional configuration on the hubs or spokes. This dynamic-mesh capability alleviates the need for any load on the hub to route data between the spoke networks.[citation needed]\nEVPN\n[edit]Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is a technology for carrying OSI layer 2 Ethernet traffic as a virtual private network using wide area network protocols. EVPN technologies include Ethernet over Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Ethernet over Virtual Extensible LAN.[21][22]\nMPLS VPN\n[edit]Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a routing technique in telecommunications networks that directs data from one node to the next based on labels rather than network addresses.[23] Whereas network addresses identify endpoints, MPLS labels identify established paths between endpoints. MPLS can encapsulate packets of various network protocols.\nIn practice, MPLS is mainly used to forward IP protocol data units and Virtual Private LAN Service Ethernet traffic. Major applications of MPLS are telecommunications traffic engineering and MPLS VPN. MPLS works in conjunction with the Internet Protocol (IP) and its routing protocols, usually interior gateway protocols (IGPs) and supports the creation of dynamic, transparent virtual networks with support for traffic engineering, the ability to transport layer VPNs with overlapping address spaces, and for layer-2 pseudowires that are capable of transporting a variety of transport payloads (IPv4, IPv6, ATM, Frame Relay, etc.).[24][25]\nVPLS\n[edit]Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a virtual private network technology that provides Ethernet-based multipoint-to-multipoint communication over IP or MPLS networks. It allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites (including both servers and clients) through pseudowires.[26] The technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or even GRE. There are two IETF standards-track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC 4762) describing VPLS establishment. In contrast to L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point OSI layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity.[27][28]\nPPVPN\n[edit]A provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) is a virtual private network (VPN) implemented by a connectivity service provider or large enterprise on a network they operate on their own, as opposed to a \"customer-provisioned VPN\" where the VPN is implemented by the customer who acquires the connectivity service on top of the technical specificities of the provider.\nProtocols\n[edit]A virtual private network is based on a tunneling protocol, and may be combined with other network or application protocols to provide additional security and capabilities.\nIPSec (1996)\n[edit]Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a standards-based security protocol, initially developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for IPv6, and was required in all standards-compliant implementations of IPv6 before RFC 6434 made it only a recommendation.[29] It is also widely used with IPv4.\nThe design of IPSec meets most security goals: availability, integrity, and confidentiality. IPsec uses encryption, encapsulating an IP packet inside an IPsec packet. De-encapsulation happens at the end of the tunnel, where the original IP packet is decrypted and forwarded to its intended destination. IPsec is also often supported by network hardware accelerators,[30] which makes IPsec VPN desirable for low-power scenarios, like always-on remote access VPN configurations.[31][32]\nIPsec tunnels are set up by the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. IPsec tunnels made with IKE version 1 (also known as IKEv1 tunnels, or often just \"IPsec tunnels\") can be used alone to provide VPN but are often combined with the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) to reuse existing L2TP-related implementations for more flexible authentication features (e.g. Xauth).\nIKE version 2, which was created by Microsoft and Cisco, can be used alone to provide IPsec VPN functionality. Its primary advantages are the native support for authenticating via the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and that the tunnel can be seamlessly restored when the IP address of the associated host is changing, which is typical of a roaming mobile device, whether on 3G or 4G LTE networks.\nTLS/SSL (1999)\n[edit]Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) can tunnel an entire network's traffic (as it does in the OpenVPN project and SoftEther VPN project[33]) or secure an individual connection. A number of vendors provide remote-access VPN capabilities through TLS. A VPN based on TLS can connect from locations where the usual TLS web navigation (HTTPS) is supported without requiring additional configuration.\nOpenSSH (1999)\n[edit]OpenSSH offers VPN tunneling (distinct from port forwarding) to secure[ambiguous] remote connections to a network, inter-network links, and remote systems. OpenSSH server provides a limited number of concurrent tunnels. The VPN feature itself does not support personal authentication.[34] SSH is more often used to remotely connect to machines or networks instead of a site to site VPN connection.\nOpenVPN (2001)\n[edit]OpenVPN is a free and open-source VPN protocol based on the TLS protocol. It supports perfect forward-secrecy, and most modern secure cipher suites, like AES, Serpent, TwoFish, etc. It is currently[may be outdated as of March 2023] being developed and updated by OpenVPN Inc., a non-profit providing secure VPN technologies.\nSSTP (2007)\n[edit]Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) is a form of VPN tunnel that provides a mechanism to transport Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) traffic through an SSL/TLS channel.\nWireguard (2015)\n[edit]WireGuard is a protocol. In 2020, WireGuard support was added to both the Linux[35] and Android[36] kernels, opening it up to adoption by VPN providers. By default, WireGuard utilizes the Curve25519 protocol for key exchange and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption and message authentication, but also includes the ability to pre-share a symmetric key between the client and server.[37]\nOther\n[edit]- Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) – used in Cisco AnyConnect VPN and in OpenConnect VPN[38] to solve the issues TLS has with tunneling over TCP (SSL/TLS are TCP-based, and tunneling TCP over TCP can lead to big delays and connection aborts[39]).\n- Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) works with the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol and in several compatible implementations on other platforms.\n- Microsoft Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) tunnels Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol traffic through an SSL/TLS channel (SSTP was introduced in Windows Server 2008 and in Windows Vista Service Pack 1).\n- Multi Path Virtual Private Network (MPVPN). Ragula Systems Development Company owns the registered trademark \"MPVPN\".[relevant?][40]\n- Crypto IP Encapsulation (CIPE) is a free and open-source VPN implementation for tunneling IPv4 packets over UDP via encapsulation.[41] CIPE was developed for Linux operating systems by Olaf Titz, with a Windows port implemented by Damion K. Wilson.[42] Development for CIPE ended in 2002.[43]\n- L2TP[44] which is a standards-based replacement for two proprietary VPN protocols: Cisco's Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F)[45] (obsolete as of 2009[update]) and Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).[46]\nNative and third-party support\n[edit]Desktop, smartphone and other end-user device operating systems usually support configuring remote access VPN from their graphical or command-line tools.[47][48][49] However, due to the variety of, often non standard, VPN protocols, there exist many third-party applications that implement additional protocols not yet or no longer natively supported by the OS. For instance, Android lacked native IPsec IKEv2 support until version 11,[50] and users needed to install third-party apps in order to connect that kind of VPN. Conversely, Windows does not natively support plain IPsec IKEv1 remote access native VPN configuration (commonly used by Cisco and Fritz!Box VPN solutions).\nNetwork appliances, such as firewalls, often include VPN gateway functionality for either remote access or site-to-site configurations. Their administration interfaces often facilitate setting up virtual private networks with a selection of supported protocols. In some cases, like in the open source operating systems devoted to firewalls and network devices (like OpenWrt, IPFire, PfSense or OPNsense), it is possible to add support for additional VPN protocols by installing missing software components or third-party apps.[citation needed]\nCommercial appliances with VPN features based on proprietary hardware or software platforms usually support a consistent VPN protocol across their products, but do not allow customizations outside the use cases they implement. This is often the case for appliances that rely on hardware acceleration of VPNs to provide higher throughput or support a larger number of simultaneously connected users.[citation needed]\nSociety and culture\n[edit]Individual users\n[edit]In 2025, 1.75 billion people use VPNs. By 2027, this market is projected to grow to $76 billion.[51]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"virtual private network\". NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary.

{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview", "title": "Overview of HTTP - HTTP | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Overview of HTTP\nHTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is typically constructed from resources such as text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.\nClients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.\nDesigned in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an application layer protocol that is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.\nComponents of HTTP-based systems\nHTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example, a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.\nEach individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer called the response. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called proxies, which perform different operations and act as gateways or caches, for example.\nIn reality, there are more computers between a browser and the server handling the request: there are routers, modems, and more. Thanks to the layered design of the Web, these are hidden in the network and transport layers. HTTP is on top, at the application layer. Although important for diagnosing network problems, the underlying layers are mostly irrelevant to the description of HTTP.\nClient: the user-agent\nThe user-agent is any tool that acts on behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser, but it may also be performed by programs used by engineers and Web developers to debug their applications.\nThe browser is always the entity initiating the request. It is never the server (though some mechanisms have been added over the years to simulate server-initiated messages).\nTo display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the page. It then parses this file, making additional requests corresponding to execution scripts, layout information (CSS) to display, and sub-resources contained within the page (usually images and videos). The Web browser then combines these resources to present the complete document, the Web page. Scripts executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and the browser updates the Web page accordingly.\nA Web page is a hypertext document. This means some parts of the displayed content are links, which can be activated (usually by a click of the mouse) to fetch a new Web page, allowing the user to direct their user-agent and navigate through the Web. The browser translates these directions into HTTP requests, and further interprets the HTTP responses to present the user with a clear response.\nThe Web server\nOn the opposite side of the communication channel is the server, which serves the document as requested by the client. A server appears as only a single machine virtually; but it may actually be a collection of servers sharing the load (load balancing), or other software (such as caches, a database server, or e-commerce servers), totally or partially generating the document on demand.\nA server is not necessarily a single machine, but several server software instances can be hosted on the same machine.\nWith HTTP/1.1 and the Host\nheader, they may even share the same IP address.\nProxies\nBetween the Web browser and the server, numerous computers and machines relay the HTTP messages. Due to the layered structure of the Web stack, most of these operate at the transport, network or physical levels, becoming transparent at the HTTP layer and potentially having a significant impact on performance. Those operating at the application layers are generally called proxies. These can be transparent, forwarding on the requests they receive without altering them in any way, or non-transparent, in which case they will change the request in some way before passing it along to the server. Proxies may perform numerous functions:\n- caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache)\n- filtering (like an antivirus scan or parental controls)\n- load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve different requests)\n- authentication (to control access to different resources)\n- logging (allowing the storage of historical information)\nBasic aspects of HTTP\n>HTTP is simple\nHTTP is generally designed to be human-readable, even with the added complexity introduced in HTTP/2 by encapsulating HTTP messages into frames. HTTP messages can be read and understood by humans, providing easier testing for developers, and reduced complexity for newcomers.\nHTTP is extensible\nIntroduced in HTTP/1.0, HTTP headers make this protocol easy to extend and experiment with. New functionality can even be introduced by an agreement between a client and a server about a new header's semantics.\nHTTP is stateless, but not sessionless\nHTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same connection. This immediately has the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact with certain pages coherently, for example, using e-commerce shopping baskets. But while the core of HTTP itself is stateless, HTTP cookies allow the use of stateful sessions. Using header extensibility, HTTP Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each HTTP request to share the same context, or the same state.\nHTTP and connections\nA connection is controlled at the transport layer, and therefore fundamentally out of scope for HTTP. HTTP doesn't require the underlying transport protocol to be connection-based; it only requires it to be reliable, or not lose messages (at minimum, presenting an error in such cases). Among the two most common transport protocols on the Internet, TCP is reliable and UDP isn't. HTTP therefore relies on the TCP standard, which is connection-based.\nBefore a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response pair, they must establish a TCP connection, a process which requires several round-trips. The default behavior of HTTP/1.0 is to open a separate TCP connection for each HTTP request/response pair. This is less efficient than sharing a single TCP connection when multiple requests are sent in close succession.\nIn order to mitigate this flaw, HTTP/1.1 introduced pipelining (which proved difficult to implement) and persistent connections: the underlying TCP connection can be partially controlled using the Connection\nheader.\nHTTP/2 went a step further by multiplexing messages over a single connection, helping keep the connection warm and more efficient.\nExperiments are in progress to design a better transport protocol more suited to HTTP. For example, Google is experimenting with QUIC which builds on UDP to provide a more reliable and efficient transport protocol.\nWhat can be controlled by HTTP\nThis extensible nature of HTTP has, over time, allowed for more control and functionality of the Web. Cache and authentication methods were functions handled early in HTTP history. The ability to relax the origin constraint, by contrast, was only added in the 2010s.\nHere is a list of common features controllable with HTTP:\n- Caching: How documents are cached can be controlled by HTTP. The server can instruct proxies and clients about what to cache and for how long. The client can instruct intermediate cache proxies to ignore the stored document.\n- Relaxing the origin constraint: To prevent snooping and other privacy invasions, Web browsers enforce strict separation between websites. Only pages from the same origin can access all the information of a Web page. Though such a constraint is a burden to the server, HTTP headers can relax this strict separation on the server side, allowing a document to become a patchwork of information sourced from different domains; there could even be security-related reasons to do so.\n- Authentication:\nSome pages may be protected so that only specific users can access them.\nBasic authentication may be provided by HTTP, either using the\nWWW-Authenticate\nand similar headers, or by setting a specific session using HTTP cookies. - Proxy and tunneling: Servers or clients are often located on intranets and hide their true IP address from other computers. HTTP requests then go through proxies to cross this network barrier. Not all proxies are HTTP proxies. The SOCKS protocol, for example, operates at a lower level. Other protocols, like ftp, can be handled by these proxies.\n- Sessions: Using HTTP cookies allows you to link requests with the state of the server. This creates sessions, despite basic HTTP being a state-less protocol. This is useful not only for e-commerce shopping baskets, but also for any site allowing user configuration of the output.\nHTTP flow\nWhen a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or an intermediate proxy, it performs the following steps:\n-\nOpen a TCP connection: The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an answer. The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP connections to the servers.\n-\nSend an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these messages are encapsulated in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle remains the same. For example:\nhttpGET / HTTP/1.1 Host: developer.mozilla.org Accept-Language: fr\n-\nRead the response sent by the server, such as:\nhttpHTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:28:02 GMT Server: Apache Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Dec 2009 20:18:22 GMT ETag: \"51142bc1-7449-479b075b2891b\" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 29769 Content-Type: text/html <!doctype html>â¦ (here come the 29769 bytes of the requested web page)\n-\nClose or reuse the connection for further requests.\nIf HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without waiting for the first response to be fully received. HTTP pipelining has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has been superseded in HTTP/2 with more robust multiplexing requests within a frame.\nHTTP Messages\nHTTP messages, as defined in HTTP/1.1 and earlier, are human-readable. In HTTP/2, these messages are embedded into a binary structure, a frame, allowing optimizations like compression of headers and multiplexing. Even if only part of the original HTTP message is sent in this version of HTTP, the semantics of each message is unchanged and the client reconstitutes (virtually) the original HTTP/1.1 request. It is therefore useful to comprehend HTTP/2 messages in the HTTP/1.1 format.\nThere are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format.\nRequests\nAn example HTTP request:\nRequests consist of the following elements:\n- An HTTP method, usually a verb like\nGET\n,POST\n, or a noun likeOPTIONS\norHEAD\nthat defines the operation the client wants to perform. Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (usingGET\n) or post the value of an HTML form (usingPOST\n), though more operations may be needed in other cases. - The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious from the context, for example without the protocol (\nhttp://\n), the domain (here,developer.mozilla.org\n), or the TCP port (here,80\n). - The version of the HTTP protocol.\n- Optional headers that convey additional information for the servers.\n- A body, for some methods like\nPOST\n, similar to those in responses, which contain the resource sent.\nResponses\nAn example response:\nResponses consist of the following elements:\n- The version of the HTTP protocol they follow.\n- A status code, indicating if the request was successful or not, and why.\n- A status message, a non-authoritative short description of the status code.\n- HTTP headers, like those for requests.\n- Optionally, a body containing the fetched resource.\nAPIs based on HTTP\nThe most commonly used API based on HTTP is the Fetch API, which can be used to make HTTP requests from JavaScript. The Fetch API replaces the XMLHttpRequest\nAPI.\nAnother API, server-sent events, is a one-way service that allows a server to send events to the client, using HTTP as a transport mechanism.\nUsing the EventSource\ninterface, the client opens a connection and establishes event handlers.\nThe client browser automatically converts the messages that arrive on the HTTP stream into appropriate Event\nobjects. Then it delivers them to the event handlers that have been registered for the events' type\nif known, or to the onmessage\nevent handler if no type-specific event handler was established.\nConclusion\nHTTP is an extensible protocol that is easy to use. The client-server structure, combined with the ability to add headers, allows HTTP to advance along with the extended capabilities of the Web.\nThough HTTP/2 adds some complexity by embedding HTTP messages in frames to improve performance, the basic structure of messages has stayed the same since HTTP/1.0. Session flow remains basic, allowing it to be investigated and debugged with a HTTP network monitor.\nSee also\n- Evolution of HTTP\n- Glossary terms:"}
{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods", "title": "HTTP request methods - HTTP | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "HTTP request methods\nHTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the purpose of the request and what is expected if the request is successful. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each request method has its own semantics, but some characteristics are shared across multiple methods, specifically request methods can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.\nGET\n-\nThe\nGET\nmethod requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests usingGET\nshould only retrieve data and should not contain a request content. HEAD\n-\nThe\nHEAD\nmethod asks for a response identical to aGET\nrequest, but without a response body. POST\n-\nThe\nPOST\nmethod submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. PUT\n-\nThe\nPUT\nmethod replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request content. DELETE\n-\nThe\nDELETE\nmethod deletes the specified resource. CONNECT\n-\nThe\nCONNECT\nmethod establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource. OPTIONS\n-\nThe\nOPTIONS\nmethod describes the communication options for the target resource. TRACE\n-\nThe\nTRACE\nmethod performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource. PATCH\n-\nThe\nPATCH\nmethod applies partial modifications to a resource.\nSafe, idempotent, and cacheable request methods\nThe following table lists HTTP request methods and their categorization in terms of safety, cacheability, and idempotency.\n| Method | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable |\n|---|---|---|---|\nGET |\nYes | Yes | Yes |\nHEAD |\nYes | Yes | Yes |\nOPTIONS |\nYes | Yes | No |\nTRACE |\nYes | Yes | No |\nPUT |\nNo | Yes | No |\nDELETE |\nNo | Yes | No |\nPOST |\nNo | No | Conditional* |\nPATCH |\nNo | No | Conditional* |\nCONNECT |\nNo | No | No |\n* POST\nand PATCH\nare cacheable when responses explicitly include freshness information and a matching Content-Location\nheader.\nSpecifications\n| Specification |\n|---|\n| HTTP Semantics> # OPTIONS> |\n| HTTP Semantics> # PUT> |\n| HTTP Semantics> # POST> |\n| HTTP Semantics> # GET> |\n| HTTP Semantics> # HEAD> |\n| HTTP Semantics> # DELETE> |\n| HTTP Semantics> # CONNECT> |"}
{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status", "title": "HTTP response status codes - HTTP | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "HTTP response status codes\nHTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:\n- Informational responses (\n100\nâ199\n) - Successful responses (\n200\nâ299\n) - Redirection messages (\n300\nâ399\n) - Client error responses (\n400\nâ499\n) - Server error responses (\n500\nâ599\n)\nThe status codes listed below are defined by RFC 9110.\nNote: If you receive a response that is not listed here, it is a non-standard response, possibly custom to the server's software.\nInformational responses\n100 Continue\n-\nThis interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.\n101 Switching Protocols\n-\nThis code is sent in response to an\nUpgrade\nrequest header from the client and indicates the protocol the server is switching to. 102 Processing\nDeprecated-\nThis code was used in WebDAV contexts to indicate that a request has been received by the server, but no status was available at the time of the response.\n103 Early Hints\n-\nThis status code is primarily intended to be used with the\nLink\nheader, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response or preconnect to an origin from which the page will need resources.\nSuccessful responses\n200 OK\n-\nThe request succeeded. The result and meaning of \"success\" depends on the HTTP method:\nGET\n: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.HEAD\n: Representation headers are included in the response without any message body.PUT\norPOST\n: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.TRACE\n: The message body contains the request as received by the server.\n201 Created\n-\nThe request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after\nPOST\nrequests, or somePUT\nrequests. 202 Accepted\n-\nThe request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.\n-\nThis response code means the returned metadata is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the\n200 OK\nresponse is preferred to this status. 204 No Content\n-\nThere is no content to send for this request, but the headers are useful. The user agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.\n205 Reset Content\n-\nTells the user agent to reset the document which sent this request.\n206 Partial Content\n-\nThis response code is used in response to a range request when the client has requested a part or parts of a resource.\n207 Multi-Status\n(WebDAV)-\nConveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.\n208 Already Reported\n(WebDAV)-\nUsed inside a\n<dav:propstat>\nresponse element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection. 226 IM Used\n(HTTP Delta encoding)-\nThe server has fulfilled a\nGET\nrequest for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.\nRedirection messages\n300 Multiple Choices\n-\nIn agent-driven content negotiation, the request has more than one possible response and the user agent or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way for clients to automatically choose one of the responses, so this is rarely used.\n301 Moved Permanently\n-\nThe URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the response.\n302 Found\n-\nThis response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. Further changes in the URI might be made in the future, so the same URI should be used by the client in future requests.\n303 See Other\n-\nThe server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a\nGET\nrequest. 304 Not Modified\n-\nThis is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same cached version of the response.\n305 Use Proxy\nDeprecated-\nDefined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy. It has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band configuration of a proxy.\n306 unused\n-\nThis response code is no longer used; but is reserved. It was used in a previous version of the HTTP/1.1 specification.\n307 Temporary Redirect\n-\nThe server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with the same method that was used in the prior request. This has the same semantics as the\n302 Found\nresponse code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: if aPOST\nwas used in the first request, aPOST\nmust be used in the redirected request. 308 Permanent Redirect\n-\nThis means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the\nLocation\nresponse header. This has the same semantics as the301 Moved Permanently\nHTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: if aPOST\nwas used in the first request, aPOST\nmust be used in the second request.\nClient error responses\n400 Bad Request\n-\nThe server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).\n-\nAlthough the HTTP standard specifies \"unauthorized\", semantically this response means \"unauthenticated\". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.\n402 Payment Required\n-\nThe initial purpose of this code was for digital payment systems, however this status code is rarely used and no standard convention exists.\n403 Forbidden\n-\nThe client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike\n401 Unauthorized\n, the client's identity is known to the server. 404 Not Found\n-\nThe server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of\n403 Forbidden\nto hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. 405 Method Not Allowed\n-\nThe request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. For example, an API may not allow\nDELETE\non a resource, or theTRACE\nmethod entirely. 406 Not Acceptable\n-\nThis response is sent when the web server, after performing server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent.\n407 Proxy Authentication Required\n-\nThis is similar to\n401 Unauthorized\nbut authentication is needed to be done by a proxy. 408 Request Timeout\n-\nThis response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This response is used much more since some browsers use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up browsing. Some servers may shut down a connection without sending this message.\n409 Conflict\n-\nThis response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. In WebDAV remote web authoring,\n409\nresponses are errors sent to the client so that a user might be able to resolve a conflict and resubmit the request. 410 Gone\n-\nThis response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address. Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the resource. The HTTP specification intends this status code to be used for \"limited-time, promotional services\". APIs should not feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with this status code.\n411 Length Required\n-\nServer rejected the request because the\nContent-Length\nheader field is not defined and the server requires it. 412 Precondition Failed\n-\nIn conditional requests, the client has indicated preconditions in its headers which the server does not meet.\n413 Content Too Large\n-\nThe request body is larger than limits defined by server. The server might close the connection or return a\nRetry-After\nheader field. 414 URI Too Long\n-\nThe URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.\n415 Unsupported Media Type\n-\nThe media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request.\n416 Range Not Satisfiable\n-\nThe ranges specified by the\nRange\nheader field in the request cannot be fulfilled. It's possible that the range is outside the size of the target resource's data. 417 Expectation Failed\n-\nThis response code means the expectation indicated by the\nExpect\nrequest header field cannot be met by the server. 418 I'm a teapot\n-\nThe server refuses the attempt to brew coffee with a teapot.\n421 Misdirected Request\n-\nThe request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.\n422 Unprocessable Content\n(WebDAV)-\nThe request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.\n423 Locked\n(WebDAV)-\nThe resource that is being accessed is locked.\n424 Failed Dependency\n(WebDAV)-\nThe request failed due to failure of a previous request.\n425 Too Early\nExperimental-\nIndicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.\n426 Upgrade Required\n-\nThe server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol. The server sends an\nUpgrade\nheader in a 426 response to indicate the required protocol(s). 428 Precondition Required\n-\nThe origin server requires the request to be conditional. This response is intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client\nGET\ns a resource's state, modifies it andPUT\ns it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict. 429 Too Many Requests\n-\nThe user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).\n431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n-\nThe server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request may be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.\n-\nThe user agent requested a resource that cannot legally be provided, such as a web page censored by a government.\nServer error responses\n500 Internal Server Error\n-\nThe server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. This error is generic, indicating that the server cannot find a more appropriate\n5XX\nstatus code to respond with. 501 Not Implemented\n-\nThe request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled. The only methods that servers are required to support (and therefore that must not return this code) are\nGET\nandHEAD\n. 502 Bad Gateway\n-\nThis error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.\n-\nThe server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. Note that together with this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem should be sent. This response should be used for temporary conditions and the\nRetry-After\nHTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time before the recovery of the service. The webmaster must also take care about the caching-related headers that are sent along with this response, as these temporary condition responses should usually not be cached. 504 Gateway Timeout\n-\nThis error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.\n505 HTTP Version Not Supported\n-\nThe HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server.\n506 Variant Also Negotiates\n-\nThe server has an internal configuration error: during content negotiation, the chosen variant is configured to engage in content negotiation itself, which results in circular references when creating responses.\n507 Insufficient Storage\n(WebDAV)-\nThe method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.\n508 Loop Detected\n(WebDAV)-\nThe server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.\n510 Not Extended\n-\nThe client request declares an HTTP Extension (RFC 2774) that should be used to process the request, but the extension is not supported.\n511 Network Authentication Required\n-\nIndicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access."}

Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. Tarrare travelled around France in the company of a band of prostitutes and thieves before becoming the warm-up act for a travelling charlatan. In this act, he swallowed corks, stones, live animals, and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to Paris, where he worked as a street performer. At the start of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army, where even quadrupling the standard military ration was unable to satisfy his large appetite. He ate any available food from gutters and rubbish heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity.

The Iberian lynx is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, in which it was once widespread, but it is now restricted to a small number of regions in Spain and Portugal, and is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Fossils suggest that the species has been present in Iberia since the end of the Early Pleistocene, around one million years ago. The Iberian lynx has a short bright yellowish to tawny coloured spotted fur. Its body is short with long legs and a short tail, and its head is small with tufted ears and a ruff (hairs under the neck). It preys foremost on the European rabbit for the bulk of its diet, supplemented by red-legged partridge, rodents, and to a smaller degree also on wild ungulates. The Iberian lynx marks its territory with its urine, scratch marks on the barks of trees, and scat. The home ranges of adults are stable over many years and both males and females reach sexual maturity at one year old, although they rarely start breeding until a territory becomes vacant. This wild female Iberian lynx was photographed in Almuradiel, in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain.

Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, with articles that usually contain numerous links guiding readers to more information.\nWritten collaboratively by volunteers known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with Internet access, except in limited cases in which editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion visitors each month. Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-six million articles in more than 300 languages, including 7,114,491 articles in English, with 276,671 active contributors in the past month.\nWikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. While the Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines, new editors do not need to be familiar with them before they start contributing.\nAnyone can edit Wikipedia's text, data, references, and images. The quality of content is more important than the expertise of who contributes it. Wikipedia's content must conform with its policies, including being verifiable by published reliable sources. Contributions based on personal opinions, beliefs, or personal experiences, unreviewed research, libellous material, and copyright violations are not allowed, and will not remain. Wikipedia's software makes it easy to reverse errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits.\nWikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. Anyone can instantly improve it, add quality information, remove misinformation, and fix errors and vandalism. Since Wikipedia is continually updated, encyclopedic articles on major news events appear within minutes.\nFor over 24 years, editors have volunteered their time and talents to create history's most comprehensive encyclopedia while providing references and other resources to researchers worldwide (see Researching with Wikipedia). In summary, Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since 2001 and has found that it succeeds."}

We urge you to upload it to the Commons unless there is a very good reason for it to stay local.

Even if you think it would make for a great addition to an article. We really take these copyright rules very seriously on Wikipedia. Note that media is assumed to be fully-copyrighted unless shown otherwise; the burden is on the uploader.\nIn particular, please don't upload:\n- any file you simply found on some website, without knowing who its author or copyright owner is.\n- any file you found somewhere, even if you have good reason to believe it has a copyright owner who would not mind us using it, but you don't have an explicit licensing statement from them.\n- any file that was released for publicity purposes by its owners but doesn't have a fully-free license for free re-use for all purposes.\n- any file credited to a commercial image agency, such as Reuters, AP or Getty Images. Such files normally cannot be used even under the \"Fair Use\" rules, except in rare cases.\n- any file that is licensed for use exclusively on Wikipedia, or is free except that the free license excludes commercial use.\nIf you are in any doubt, please ask some experienced editors for advice before uploading. People will be happy to assist you at Wikipedia:Media copyright questions. Thank you.\n|"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability", "title": "Wikipedia:Verifiability - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Wikipedia:Verifiability\nThis page documents an English Wikipedia policy. It describes a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Substantive edits to this page should reflect consensus. |\n| This page in a nutshell: People must be able to check that facts and claims in Wikipedia articles are not just made up. This means each fact or claim must be attributable to reliable, published sources. Additionally, quotations and any facts or claims challenged or likely to be challenged must be supported by inline citations. |\nIn the English Wikipedia, verifiability means that people can check that facts or claims correspond to reliable sources. Wikipedia's content is determined by published information rather than editors' beliefs, experiences, or previously unpublished ideas or information. Even if you are sure something is true, it must have been previously published in a reliable source before you can add it.[a] If reliable sources disagree with each other, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.\nEach fact or claim in an article must be verifiable. Additionally, four types of information must be accompanied by an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material:\n- direct quotations,\n- material whose verifiability has been challenged,\n- material whose verifiability is likely to be challenged, and\n- contentious material about living and recently deceased persons.\nWhen material that needs an inline citation appears in two or more articles, an inline citation is needed in each.\nAny material that needs an inline citation but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people (or existing groups) that is unsourced or poorly sourced.\nFor how to write citations, see citing sources. Verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view are Wikipedia's core content policies. They work together to determine content, so editors should understand the key points of all three. Articles must also comply with the copyright policy.\nResponsibility for providing citations\nAll content must be verifiable. A fact or claim is \"verifiable\" if a reliable source that supports it could be cited, even if there is no citation for it in the article at the moment. The burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with the editor who adds or restores material, and it is satisfied by providing one inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the contribution.[c]\nThe cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly, ideally giving page number(s)—though sometimes a section, chapter, or other division is appropriate instead; see Wikipedia:Citing sources for details of how to do this.\nFacts or claims without an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] them may be removed. They should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source.\nWhether or how quickly material should be removed for lacking an inline citation to a reliable source depends on the material and the overall state of the article. Consider adding a citation needed tag as an interim step to removing unsourced material, to allow references to be added.[d] When tagging or removing material for lacking an inline citation, state your concern that it may not be possible to find a published reliable source, and the material therefore may not be verifiable.[e] If you think the material is verifiable, you are encouraged to provide an inline citation yourself before removing or tagging it.\nDo not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living people or existing groups, and do not move it to the talk page. The biographies of living persons policy also applies to some groups.\nReliable sources\nWhat counts as a reliable source\nA cited source on Wikipedia is often a specific portion of text (such as a short article or a page in a book). But when editors discuss sources (for example, to debate their appropriateness or reliability) they are usually talking about one or more related characteristics:\n- The work itself (the article, book) and works like it (\"An obituary can be a useful biographical source\", \"A recent source is better than an old one\")\n- The creator of the work (the writer, journalist: \"What do we know about that source's reputation?\") and people like them (\"A medical researcher is a better source than a journalist for medical claims\").\n- The publication (for example, the newspaper, journal, magazine: \"That source covers the arts.\") and publications like them (\"A newspaper is not a reliable source for medical claims\").\n- The publisher of the work (for example, Cambridge University Press: \"That source publishes reference works.\") and publishers like them (\"An academic publisher is a good source of reference works\").\nAll four can affect reliability.\nBase articles on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must be published, on Wikipedia meaning made available to the public in some form.[f] Unpublished material is not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.\nIf available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources on topics such as history, medicine, and science.\nEditors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:\n- University-level textbooks\n- Books published by respected publishing houses\n- Mainstream (non-fringe) magazines, including specialty ones\n- Reputable newspapers\nEditors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria (see details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources).\nBest sources\nThe best sources have a professional structure for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source.\nNewspaper and magazine blogs\nSome newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host online pages or columns they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because blogs may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process.[g] If a news organization publishes an opinion piece in a blog, attribute the statement to the writer, e.g. \"Jane Smith wrote ...\" Never use the blog comments that are left by the readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources, see § Self-published sources below.\nReliable sources noticeboard and guideline\nTo discuss the reliability of a specific source for a particular statement, consult Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which seeks to apply this policy to particular cases. For a guideline discussing the reliability of particular types of sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources. In case of conflict between this policy and the Wikipedia:Reliable sources guideline, or any other guideline related to sourcing, this policy has priority.\nSources that are usually not reliable\nQuestionable sources\nQuestionable sources are those that have a poor reputation for checking the facts, lack meaningful editorial oversight, or have an apparent conflict of interest.\nSuch sources include websites and publications expressing views widely considered by other sources to be promotional, extremist, or that rely heavily on unsubstantiated gossip, rumor, or personal opinion. Questionable sources should be used only as sources for material on themselves, such as in articles about themselves; see below. They are not suitable sources for contentious claims.\nPredatory open access journals are questionable due to the absence of quality control in the peer-review process.\nSelf-published sources\nAnyone can create a personal web page, self-publish a book, or claim to be an expert. Self-published material, such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs (as distinguished from newsblogs, above), content farms, podcasts, Internet forum postings, and social media postings, are largely not acceptable as sources.\nSelf-published sources may be considered reliable if published by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications.[g] Be careful when using such sources: if the information in question is suitable for inclusion, someone else will likely have published it in independent, reliable sources.[1] Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.\nSelf-published or questionable sources as sources on themselves\nSelf-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they are established experts in the field, so long as:\n- The material is neither unduly self-serving nor an exceptional claim;\n- It does not involve claims about third parties;\n- It does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source;\n- There is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity; and\n- The article is not based primarily on such sources.\nThis policy also applies to material made public by the source on social networking websites such as Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram and Facebook.\nWikipedia and sources that mirror or use it\nDo not use articles from Wikipedia (whether English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources, since Wikipedia is a user-generated source. Do not use websites mirroring Wikipedia content or publications relying on material from Wikipedia as sources. Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly.[2]\nAn exception is allowed when Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article. These may cite content from Wikipedia or a sister project to support a statement about Wikipedia. Wikipedia or the sister project is a primary source in this case and may be used following the policy for primary sources. Any such use should avoid original research, undue emphasis on Wikipedia's role or views, and inappropriate self-reference. The article text should say that the material is sourced from Wikipedia.\nAccessibility\nAccess to sources\nDo not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. Some reliable sources are not easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only through libraries. Rare historical sources may even be available only in special museum collections and archives. If you have trouble accessing a source, others might do so for you (see WikiProject Resource Exchange).\nNon-English sources\nCiting\nCitations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. However, because this project is in English, English-language sources are preferred over non-English ones when they are available and of equal quality and relevance. As with sources in English, if a dispute arises involving a citation to a non-English source, editors may request a quotation of relevant portions of the original source be provided, either in text, in a footnote, or on the article talk page.[h] (See Template:Request quotation.)\nQuoting\nIf you quote a non-English reliable source (whether in the main text or in a footnote), a translation into English should accompany the quote. Translations published by reliable sources are preferred over translations by Wikipedians, but translations by Wikipedians are preferred over machine translations. When using a machine translation of source material, editors should be reasonably certain that the translation is accurate and the source is appropriate. Editors should not rely upon machine translations of non-English sources in contentious articles or biographies of living people. If needed, ask an editor who can translate it for you.\nThe original text is usually included with the translated text in articles when translated by Wikipedians, and the translating editor is usually not cited. When quoting any material, whether in English or in some other language, be careful not to violate copyright; see the fair-use guideline.\nOther issues\nVerifiability does not guarantee inclusion\nWhile information must be verifiable for inclusion in an article, not all verifiable information must be included. Consensus may determine that inclusion of a verifiable fact or claim does not improve an article, and other policies may indicate that the material is inappropriate. Such information should be omitted or presented instead in a different article.\nBuild consensus\nThe responsibility for achieving consensus for inclusion is on those seeking to include disputed content.\nTagging a sentence, section, or article\nIf you want to request an inline citation for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the {{citation needed}} template. You can also leave a note on the talk page asking for a source, or move the material to the talk page and ask for a source there. To request verification that a reference supports the text, tag it with {{verification needed}}. Material that fails verification may be tagged with {{failed verification}} or removed. It helps other editors to explain your rationale for using templates to tag material in the template, edit summary, or on the talk page.\nTake special care with contentious material about living and recently deceased people. Unsourced or poorly sourced material that is contentious, especially text that is negative, derogatory, or potentially damaging, should be removed immediately rather than tagged or moved to the talk page.\nExceptional claims require exceptional sourcing\nAny exceptional claim requires multiple high-quality sources.[3] Warnings (red flags) that should prompt extra caution include:\n- Surprising or apparently important claims not covered by multiple mainstream sources;\n- Challenged claims that are supported purely by primary or self-published sources or those with an apparent conflict of interest;\n- Reports of a statement by someone that seems out of character or against an interest they had previously defended;\n- Claims contradicted by the prevailing view within the relevant community or that would significantly alter mainstream assumptions—especially in science, medicine, history, politics, and biographies of living and recently deceased people. This is especially true when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them.\nVerifiability and other principles\nCopyright and plagiarism\nDo not plagiarize or breach copyright when using sources. Summarize source material in your own words as much as possible; when quoting or closely paraphrasing a source, use an inline citation, and in-text attribution where appropriate.\nDo not link to any source that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. You can link to websites that display copyrighted works as long as the website has licensed the work or uses the work in a way compliant with fair use. Knowingly directing others to material that violates copyright may be considered contributory copyright infringement. If there is reason to think a source violates copyright, do not cite it. This is particularly relevant when linking to sites such as Scribd or YouTube, where due care should be taken to avoid linking to material violating copyright.\nNeutrality\nEven when information is cited to reliable sources, you must present it with a neutral point of view (NPOV). Articles should be based on thorough research of sources. All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. If there is a disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: \"John Smith argues X, while Paul Jones maintains Y,\" followed by an inline citation. Sources themselves do not need to maintain a neutral point of view. Indeed, many reliable sources are not neutral. Our job as editors is simply to summarize what reliable sources say.\nNotability\nIf no reliable, independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it (i.e., the topic is not notable). However, notability is based on the existence of suitable sources, not on the state of sourcing in an article.\nOriginal research\nThe no original research policy (NOR) is closely related to the Verifiability policy. Among its requirements are:\n- All material in Wikipedia articles must be attributable to a reliable published source. This means a reliable published source must exist for it, whether or not it is cited in the article.\n- Sources must support the material clearly and directly: drawing inferences from multiple sources to advance a novel position is prohibited by the NOR policy.[h]\n- Base articles largely on reliable secondary sources. While primary sources are appropriate in some cases, relying on them can be problematic. For more information, see the Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources section of the NOR policy, and the Misuse of primary sources section of the BLP policy.\nSee also\nGuidelines\nInformation pages\nResources\n- Backlog – links to articles that need citations added\n- Template index/Sources of articles – maintenance templates for articles with sourcing problems\n- The Wikipedia Library – free access to newspapers, journals, and magazines for experienced editors\n- WikiProject Resource Exchange – where you can ask for help with checking an individual source\nEssays\nNotes\n- ^ This principle was historically expressed as \"the threshold for inclusion is verifiability, not truth\". See the essay, Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth.\n- ^ a b c A source \"directly supports\" a given piece of material if the information is present explicitly in the source, so that using this source to support the material is not a violation of Wikipedia:No original research. The location of any citation—including whether one is present in the article at all—is unrelated to whether a source directly supports the material. For questions about where and how to place citations, see Wikipedia:Citing sources, Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section § Citations, etc.\n- ^ Once an editor has provided any source they believe, in good faith, to be sufficient, then any editor who later removes the material must articulate specific problems that would justify its exclusion from Wikipedia (e.g., why the source is unreliable; the source does not support the claim; undue emphasis; unencyclopedic content; etc.). If necessary, all editors are then expected to help achieve consensus, and any problems with the text or sourcing should be fixed before the material is added back.\n- ^ When an article contains a lot of uncited information, it may be impractical to add specific {{citation needed}} tags. Consider then tagging a section with {{unreferenced section}}, or the article with the applicable of either {{unreferenced}} or {{more citations needed}}. For a disputed category, you may use {{unreferenced category}}. For a disambiguation page, consider asking for a citation on the talk page.\n- ^ When tagging or removing such material, please communicate your reasons why. Some editors object to others making frequent and large-scale deletions of unsourced information, especially if unaccompanied by other efforts to improve the material. Do not concentrate only on material of a particular point of view, as that may appear to be a contravention of Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Also, check to see whether the material is sourced to a citation elsewhere on the page. For all these reasons, it is advisable to clearly communicate that you have a considered reason to believe the material in question cannot be verified.\n- ^ This includes material such as documents in publicly accessible archives as well as inscriptions in plain sight, e.g. tombstones.\n- ^ a b Note that any exceptional claim would require exceptional sources.\n- ^ a b When there is a dispute as to whether a piece of text is fully supported by a given source, direct quotes and other relevant details from the source should be provided to other editors as a courtesy.

The field draws on theories and methods including graph theory from mathematics, statistical mechanics from physics, data mining and information visualization from computer science, inferential modeling from statistics, and social structure from sociology. The United States National Research Council defines network science as \"the study of network representations of physical, biological, and social phenomena leading to predictive models of these phenomena.\"[1]\nBackground and history\n[edit]The study of networks has emerged in diverse disciplines as a means of analyzing complex relational data. The earliest known paper in this field is the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg written by Leonhard Euler in 1736. Euler's mathematical description of vertices and edges was the foundation of graph theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of pairwise relations in a network structure. The field of graph theory continued to develop and found applications in chemistry.[2]\nDénes Kőnig, a Hungarian mathematician and professor, wrote the first book in Graph Theory, entitled \"Theory of finite and infinite graphs\", in 1936.[3]\nIn the 1930s Jacob Moreno, a psychologist in the Gestalt tradition, arrived in the United States. He developed the sociogram and presented it to the public in April 1933 at a convention of medical scholars. Moreno claimed that \"before the advent of sociometry no one knew what the interpersonal structure of a group 'precisely' looked like\".[4] The sociogram was a representation of the social structure of a group of elementary school students. The boys were friends of boys and the girls were friends of girls with the exception of one boy who said he liked a single girl. The feeling was not reciprocated. This network representation of social structure was found so intriguing that it was printed in The New York Times.[5] The sociogram has found many applications and has grown into the field of social network analysis.[6]\nProbabilistic theory in network science developed as an offshoot of graph theory with Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi's eight famous papers on random graphs. For social networks the exponential random graph model or p* is a notational framework used to represent the probability space of a tie occurring in a social network. An alternate approach to network probability structures is the network probability matrix, which models the probability of edges occurring in a network, based on the historic presence or absence of the edge in a sample of networks.\nInterest in networks exploded around 2000, following new discoveries that offered novel mathematical framework to describe different network topologies, leading to the term 'network science'. Albert-László Barabási and Reka Albert discovered the scale-free networks[7] nature of many real networks, from the WWW to the cell. The scale-free property captures the fact that in real network hubs coexist with many small degree vertices, and the authors offered a dynamical model to explain the origin of this scale-free state.[7] Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz reconciled empirical data on networks with mathematical representation, describing the small-world network.[8]\nNetwork Classification\n[edit]Deterministic Network\n[edit]The definition of deterministic network is defined compared with the definition of probabilistic network. In un-weighted deterministic networks, edges either exist or not, usually we use 0 to represent non-existence of an edge while 1 to represent existence of an edge. In weighted deterministic networks, the edge value represents the weight of each edge, for example, the strength level.\nProbabilistic Network\n[edit]In probabilistic networks, values behind each edge represent the likelihood of the existence of each edge. For example, if one edge has a value equals to 0.9, we say the existence probability of this edge is 0.9.[9]\nNetwork properties\n[edit]Often, networks have certain attributes that can be calculated to analyze the properties & characteristics of the network. The behavior of these network properties often define network models and can be used to analyze how certain models contrast to each other. Many of the definitions for other terms used in network science can be found in Glossary of graph theory.\nSize\n[edit]The size of a network can refer to the number of nodes or, less commonly, the number of edges which (for connected graphs with no multi-edges) can range from (a tree) to (a complete graph). In the case of a simple graph (a network in which at most one (undirected) edge exists between each pair of vertices, and in which no vertices connect to themselves), we have ; for directed graphs (with no self-connected nodes), ; for directed graphs with self-connections allowed, . In the circumstance of a graph within which multiple edges may exist between a pair of vertices, .\nDensity\n[edit]The density of a network is defined as a normalized ratio between 0 and 1 of the number of edges to the number of possible edges in a network with nodes. Network density is a measure of the percentage of \"optional\" edges that exist in the network and can be computed as where and are the minimum and maximum number of edges in a connected network with nodes, respectively. In the case of simple graphs, is given by the binomial coefficient and , giving density . Another possible equation is whereas the ties are unidirectional (Wasserman & Faust 1994).[10] This gives a better overview over the network density, because unidirectional relationships can be measured.\nPlanar network density\n[edit]The density of a network, where there is no intersection between edges, is defined as a ratio of the number of edges to the number of possible edges in a network with nodes, given by a graph with no intersecting edges , giving\nAverage degree\n[edit]The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. Closely related to the density of a network is the average degree, (or, in the case of directed graphs, , the former factor of 2 arising from each edge in an undirected graph contributing to the degree of two distinct vertices). In the ER random graph model () we can compute the expected value of (equal to the expected value of of an arbitrary vertex): a random vertex has other vertices in the network available, and with probability , connects to each. Thus, .\nThe degree distribution is a fundamental property of both real networks, such as the Internet and social networks, and of theoretical models. The degree distribution P(k) of a network is defined to be the fraction of nodes in the network with degree k. The simplest network model, for example, the (Erdős–Rényi model) random graph, in which each of n nodes is independently connected (or not) with probability p (or 1 − p), has a binomial distribution of degrees k (or Poisson in the limit of large n). Most real networks, from the WWW to protein interaction networks, however, have a degree distribution that are highly right-skewed, meaning that a large majority of nodes have low degree but a small number, known as \"hubs\", have high degree. For such scale-free networks the degree distribution approximately follows a power law: , where γ is the degree exponent, and is a constant. Such scale-free networks have unexpected structural and dynamical properties, rooted in the diverging second moment of the degree distribution.[6][11][12][13][14]\nAverage shortest path length (or characteristic path length)\n[edit]The average shortest path length is calculated by finding the shortest path between all pairs of nodes, and taking the average over all paths of the length thereof (the length being the number of intermediate edges contained in the path, i.e., the distance between the two vertices within the graph). This shows us, on average, the number of steps it takes to get from one member of the network to another. The behavior of the expected average shortest path length (that is, the ensemble average of the average shortest path length) as a function of the number of vertices of a random network model defines whether that model exhibits the small-world effect; if it scales as , the model generates small-world nets. For faster-than-logarithmic growth, the model does not produce small worlds. The special case of is known as ultra-small world effect.\nDiameter of a network\n[edit]As another means of measuring network graphs, we can define the diameter of a network as the longest of all the calculated shortest paths in a network. It is the shortest distance between the two most distant nodes in the network. In other words, once the shortest path length from every node to all other nodes is calculated, the diameter is the longest of all the calculated path lengths. The diameter is representative of the linear size of a network. If node A-B-C-D are connected, going from A->D this would be the diameter of 3 (3-hops, 3-links).[citation needed]\nClustering coefficient\n[edit]The clustering coefficient is a measure of an \"all-my-friends-know-each-other\" property. This is sometimes described as the friends of my friends are my friends. More precisely, the clustering coefficient of a node is the ratio of existing links connecting a node's neighbors to each other to the maximum possible number of such links. The clustering coefficient for the entire network is the average of the clustering coefficients of all the nodes. A high clustering coefficient for a network is another indication of a small world.[6]\nThe clustering coefficient of the 'th node is\nwhere is the number of neighbours of the 'th node, and is the number of connections between these neighbours. The maximum possible number of connections between neighbors is, then,\nFrom a probabilistic standpoint, the expected local clustering coefficient is the likelihood of a link existing between two arbitrary neighbors of the same node.\nConnectedness\n[edit]The way in which a network is connected plays a large part into how networks are analyzed and interpreted. Networks are classified in four different categories:\n- Clique/Complete Graph: a completely connected network, where all nodes are connected to every other node. These networks are symmetric in that all nodes have in-links and out-links from all others.\n- Giant Component: A single connected component which contains most of the nodes in the network.\n- Weakly Connected Component: A collection of nodes in which there exists a path from any node to any other, ignoring directionality of the edges.\n- Strongly Connected Component: A collection of nodes in which there exists a directed path from any node to any other.\nNode centrality\n[edit]Centrality indices produce rankings which seek to identify the most important nodes in a network model. Different centrality indices encode different contexts for the word \"importance.\" The betweenness centrality, for example, considers a node highly important if it form bridges between many other nodes. The eigenvalue centrality, in contrast, considers a node highly important if many other highly important nodes link to it. Hundreds of such measures have been proposed in the literature.\nCentrality indices are only accurate for identifying the most important nodes. The measures are seldom, if ever, meaningful for the remainder of network nodes.[15][16] Also, their indications are only accurate within their assumed context for importance, and tend to \"get it wrong\" for other contexts.[17] For example, imagine two separate communities whose only link is an edge between the most junior member of each community. Since any transfer from one community to the other must go over this link, the two junior members will have high betweenness centrality. But, since they are junior, (presumably) they have few connections to the \"important\" nodes in their community, meaning their eigenvalue centrality would be quite low.\nNode influence\n[edit]Limitations to centrality measures have led to the development of more general measures. Two examples are the accessibility, which uses the diversity of random walks to measure how accessible the rest of the network is from a given start node,[18] and the expected force, derived from the expected value of the force of infection generated by a node.[15] Both of these measures can be meaningfully computed from the structure of the network alone.\nCommunity structure\n[edit]Nodes in a network may be partitioned into groups representing communities. Depending on the context, communities may be distinct or overlapping. Typically, nodes in such communities will be strongly connected to other nodes in the same community, but weakly connected to nodes outside the community. In the absence of a ground truth describing the community structure of a specific network, several algorithms have been developed to infer possible community structures using either supervised of unsupervised clustering methods.\nNetwork models\n[edit]Network models serve as a foundation to understanding interactions within empirical complex networks. Various random graph generation models produce network structures that may be used in comparison to real-world complex networks.\nErdős–Rényi random graph model\n[edit]The Erdős–Rényi model, named for Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi, is used for generating random graphs in which edges are set between nodes with equal probabilities. It can be used in the probabilistic method to prove the existence of graphs satisfying various properties, or to provide a rigorous definition of what it means for a property to hold for almost all graphs.\nTo generate an Erdős–Rényi model two parameters must be specified: the total number of nodes n and the probability p that a random pair of nodes has an edge.\nBecause the model is generated without bias to particular nodes, the degree distribution is binomial: for a randomly chosen vertex ,\nIn this model the clustering coefficient is 0 a.s. The behavior of can be broken into three regions.\nSubcritical : All components are simple and very small, the largest component has size ;\nCritical : ;\nSupercritical : where is the positive solution to the equation .\nThe largest connected component has high complexity. All other components are simple and small .\nConfiguration model\n[edit]The configuration model takes a degree sequence[19][20] or degree distribution[21][22] (which subsequently is used to generate a degree sequence) as the input, and produces randomly connected graphs in all respects other than the degree sequence. This means that for a given choice of the degree sequence, the graph is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all graphs that comply with this degree sequence. The degree of a randomly chosen vertex is an independent and identically distributed random variable with integer values. When , the configuration graph contains the giant connected component, which has infinite size.[20] The rest of the components have finite sizes, which can be quantified with the notion of the size distribution. The probability that a randomly sampled node is connected to a component of size is given by convolution powers of the degree distribution:[23]where denotes the degree distribution and . The giant component can be destroyed by randomly removing the critical fraction of all edges. This process is called percolation on random networks. When the second moment of the degree distribution is finite, , this critical edge fraction is given by[24] , and the average vertex-vertex distance in the giant component scales logarithmically with the total size of the network, .[22]\nIn the directed configuration model, the degree of a node is given by two numbers, in-degree and out-degree , and consequently, the degree distribution is two-variate. The expected number of in-edges and out-edges coincides, so that . The directed configuration model contains the giant component iff[25]Note that and are equal and therefore interchangeable in the latter inequality. The probability that a randomly chosen vertex belongs to a component of size is given by:[26]for in-components, and\nfor out-components.\nWatts–Strogatz small world model\n[edit]The Watts and Strogatz model is a random graph generation model that produces graphs with small-world properties.\nAn initial lattice structure is used to generate a Watts–Strogatz model. Each node in the network is initially linked to its closest neighbors. Another parameter is specified as the rewiring probability. Each edge has a probability that it will be rewired to the graph as a random edge. The expected number of rewired links in the model is .\nAs the Watts–Strogatz model begins as a non-random lattice structure, it has a very high clustering coefficient along with a high average path length. Each rewire is likely to create a shortcut between highly connected clusters. As the rewiring probability increases, the clustering coefficient decreases slower than the average path length. In effect, this allows the average path length of the network to decrease significantly with only slight decreases in the clustering coefficient. Higher values of p force more rewired edges, which, in effect, makes the Watts–Strogatz model a random network.\nBarabási–Albert (BA) preferential attachment model\n[edit]The Barabási–Albert model is a random network model used to demonstrate a preferential attachment or a \"rich-get-richer\" effect. In this model, an edge is most likely to attach to nodes with higher degrees. The network begins with an initial network of m0 nodes. m0 ≥ 2 and the degree of each node in the initial network should be at least 1, otherwise it will always remain disconnected from the rest of the network.\nIn the BA model, new nodes are added to the network one at a time. Each new node is connected to existing nodes with a probability that is proportional to the number of links that the existing nodes already have. Formally, the probability pi that the new node is connected to node i is[27]\nwhere ki is the degree of node i. Heavily linked nodes (\"hubs\") tend to quickly accumulate even more links, while nodes with only a few links are unlikely to be chosen as the destination for a new link. The new nodes have a \"preference\" to attach themselves to the already heavily linked nodes.\nThe degree distribution resulting from the BA model is scale free, in particular, for large degree it is a power law of the form:\nHubs exhibit high betweenness centrality which allows short paths to exist between nodes. As a result, the BA model tends to have very short average path lengths. The clustering coefficient of this model also tends to 0.\nThe Barabási–Albert model[28] was developed for undirected networks, aiming to explain the universality of the scale-free property, and applied to a wide range of different networks and applications. The directed version of this model is the Price model[29][30] which was developed to just citation networks.\nNon-linear preferential attachment\n[edit]In non-linear preferential attachment (NLPA), existing nodes in the network gain new edges proportionally to the node degree raised to a constant positive power, .[31] Formally, this means that the probability that node gains a new edge is given by\nIf , NLPA reduces to the BA model and is referred to as \"linear\". If , NLPA is referred to as \"sub-linear\" and the degree distribution of the network tends to a stretched exponential distribution. If , NLPA is referred to as \"super-linear\" and a small number of nodes connect to almost all other nodes in the network. For both and , the scale-free property of the network is broken in the limit of infinite system size. However, if is only slightly larger than , NLPA may result in degree distributions which appear to be transiently scale free.[32]\nFitness model\n[edit]Another model where the key ingredient is the nature of the vertex has been introduced by Caldarelli et al.[33] Here a link is created between two vertices with a probability given by a linking function of the fitnesses of the vertices involved. The degree of a vertex i is given by [34]\nIf is an invertible and increasing function of , then the probability distribution is given by\nAs a result, if the fitnesses are distributed as a power law, then also the node degree does.\nLess intuitively with a fast decaying probability distribution as together with a linking function of the kind\nwith a constant and the Heavyside function, we also obtain scale-free networks.\nSuch model has been successfully applied to describe trade between nations by using GDP as fitness for the various nodes and a linking function of the kind [35][36]\nExponential random graph models\n[edit]Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) are a family of statistical models for analyzing data from social and other networks.[6][37] The Exponential family is a broad family of models for covering many types of data, not just networks. An ERGM is a model from this family which describes networks.\nWe adopt the notation to represent a random graph via a set of nodes and a collection of tie variables , indexed by pairs of nodes , where if the nodes are connected by an edge and otherwise.\nThe basic assumption of ERGMs is that the structure in an observed graph can be explained by a given vector of sufficient statistics which are a function of the observed network and, in some cases, nodal attributes. The probability of a graph in an ERGM is defined by:\nwhere is a vector of model parameters associated with and is a normalising constant.\nNetwork analysis\n[edit]Social network analysis\n[edit]Social network analysis examines the structure of relationships between social entities.[6][38] These entities are often persons, but may also be groups, organizations, nation states, web sites, scholarly publications.\nSince the 1970s, the empirical study of networks has played a central role in social science, and many of the mathematical and statistical tools used for studying networks have been first developed in sociology.[6][39] Amongst many other applications, social network analysis has been used to understand the diffusion of innovation, news and rumors. Similarly, it has been used to examine the spread of both diseases and health-related behaviors. It has also been applied to the study of markets, where it has been used to examine the role of trust in exchange relationships and of social mechanisms in setting prices. Similarly, it has been used to study recruitment into political movements and social organizations. It has also been used to conceptualize scientific disagreements as well as academic prestige. More recently, network analysis (and its close cousin traffic analysis) has gained a significant use in military intelligence, for uncovering insurgent networks of both hierarchical and leaderless nature.[40][41] In criminology, it is being used to identify influential actors in criminal gangs, offender movements, co-offending, predict criminal activities and make policies.[42] In recent years, the literature on **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** has expanded to include contributions that combine theoretical approaches with advanced applications to complex socio-economic contexts. An example is the volume Elements of Network Science. Theory, Methods and Applications in Stata, R and Python by Antonio Zinilli (2025), which integrates the perspective of network science with that of the social and economic sciences. The book stands out for the inclusion of statistical methods for both static and dynamic networks, and its application to real-world cases concerning innovation, social capital, scientific networks, and complex economic systems.[6]\nDynamic network analysis\n[edit]Dynamic network analysis examines the shifting structure of relationships among different classes of entities in complex socio-technical systems effects, and reflects social stability and changes such as the emergence of new groups, topics, and leaders.[43][44][45] Dynamic Network Analysis focuses on meta-networks composed of multiple types of nodes (entities) and multiple types of links. These entities can be highly varied. Examples include people, organizations, topics, resources, tasks, events, locations, and beliefs.\nDynamic network techniques are particularly useful for assessing trends and changes in networks over time, identification of emergent leaders, and examining the co-evolution of people and ideas.\nBiological network analysis\n[edit]With the recent explosion of publicly available high throughput biological data, the analysis of molecular networks has gained significant interest. The type of analysis in this content are closely related to social network analysis, but often focusing on local patterns in the network. For example, network motifs are small subgraphs that are over-represented in the network. Activity motifs are similar over-represented patterns in the attributes of nodes and edges in the network that are over represented given the network structure. The analysis of biological networks has led to the development of network medicine, which looks at the effect of diseases in the interactome.[46]\nSemantic network analysis\n[edit]Semantic network analysis is a sub-field of network analysis that focuses on the relationships between words and concepts in a network. Words are represented as nodes and their proximity or co-occurrences in the text are represented as edges. Semantic networks are therefore graphical representations of knowledge and are commonly used in neurolinguistics and natural language processing applications. Semantic network analysis is also used as a method to analyze large texts and identify the main themes and topics (e.g., of social media posts), to reveal biases (e.g., in news coverage), or even to map an entire research field.[47]\nLink analysis\n[edit]Link analysis is a subset of network analysis, exploring associations between objects. An example may be examining the addresses of suspects and victims, the telephone numbers they have dialed, financial transactions they have partaken in during a given timeframe, and the familial relationships between these subjects as a part of the police investigation. Link analysis here provides the crucial relationships and associations between objects of different types that are not apparent from isolated pieces of information. Computer-assisted or fully automatic computer-based link analysis is increasingly employed by banks and insurance agencies in fraud detection, by telecommunication operators in telecommunication network analysis, by medical sector in epidemiology and pharmacology, in law enforcement investigations, by search engines for relevance rating (and conversely by the spammers for spamdexing and by business owners for search engine optimization), and everywhere else where relationships between many objects have to be analyzed.\nPandemic analysis\n[edit]The SIR model is one of the most well known algorithms on predicting the spread of global pandemics within an infectious population.\nSusceptible to infected\n[edit]The formula above describes the \"force\" of infection for each susceptible unit in an infectious population, where β is equivalent to the transmission rate of said disease.\nTo track the change of those susceptible in an infectious population:\nInfected to recovered\n[edit]Over time, the number of those infected fluctuates by: the specified rate of recovery, represented by but deducted to one over the average infectious period , the numbered of infectious individuals, , and the change in time, .\nInfectious period\n[edit]Whether a population will be overcome by a pandemic, with regards to the SIR model, is dependent on the value of or the \"average people infected by an infected individual.\"\nWeb link analysis\n[edit]Several Web search ranking algorithms use link-based centrality metrics, including (in order of appearance) Marchiori's Hyper Search, Google's PageRank, Kleinberg's HITS algorithm, the CheiRank and TrustRank algorithms. Link analysis is also conducted in information science and communication science in order to understand and extract information from the structure of collections of web pages. For example, the analysis might be of the interlinking between politicians' web sites or blogs.\nPageRank\n[edit]PageRank works by randomly picking \"nodes\" or websites and then with a certain probability, \"randomly jumping\" to other nodes. By randomly jumping to these other nodes, it helps PageRank completely traverse the network as some webpages exist on the periphery and would not as readily be assessed.\nEach node, , has a PageRank as defined by the sum of pages that link to times one over the outlinks or \"out-degree\" of times the \"importance\" or PageRank of .\nRandom jumping\n[edit]As explained above, PageRank enlists random jumps in attempts to assign PageRank to every website on the internet. These random jumps find websites that might not be found during the normal search methodologies such as breadth-first search and depth-first search.\nIn an improvement over the aforementioned formula for determining PageRank includes adding these random jump components. Without the random jumps, some pages would receive a PageRank of 0 which would not be good.\nThe first is , or the probability that a random jump will occur. Contrasting is the \"damping factor\", or .\nAnother way of looking at it:\nCentrality measures\n[edit]Information about the relative importance of nodes and edges in a graph can be obtained through centrality measures, widely used in disciplines like sociology. Centrality measures are essential when a network analysis has to answer questions such as: \"Which nodes in the network should be targeted to ensure that a message or information spreads to all or most nodes in the network?\" or conversely, \"Which nodes should be targeted to curtail the spread of a disease?\". Formally established measures of centrality are degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and katz centrality. The objective of network analysis generally determines the type of centrality measure(s) to be used.[38]\n- Degree centrality of a node in a network is the number of links (vertices) incident on the node.\n- Closeness centrality determines how \"close\" a node is to other nodes in a network by measuring the sum of the shortest distances (geodesic paths) between that node and all other nodes in the network.\n- Betweenness centrality determines the relative importance of a node by measuring the amount of traffic flowing through that node to other nodes in the network. This is done by measuring the fraction of paths connecting all pairs of nodes and containing the node of interest. Group Betweenness centrality measures the amount of traffic flowing through a group of nodes.\n- Eigenvector centrality is a more sophisticated version of degree centrality where the centrality of a node not only depends on the number of links incident on the node but also the quality of those links. This quality factor is determined by the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the network.\n- Katz centrality of a node is measured by summing the geodesic paths between that node and all (reachable) nodes in the network. These paths are weighted, paths connecting the node with its immediate neighbors carry higher weights than those which connect with nodes farther away from the immediate neighbors.\nSpread of content in networks\n[edit]Content in a complex network can spread via two major methods: conserved spread and non-conserved spread.[48] In conserved spread, the total amount of content that enters a complex network remains constant as it passes through. The model of conserved spread can best be represented by a pitcher containing a fixed amount of water being poured into a series of funnels connected by tubes. The pitcher represents the source, and the water represents the spread content. The funnels and connecting tubing represent the nodes and the connections between nodes, respectively. As the water passes from one funnel into another, the water disappears instantly from the funnel that was previously exposed to the water. In non-conserved spread, the content changes as it enters and passes through a complex network. The model of non-conserved spread can best be represented by a continuously running faucet running through a series of funnels connected by tubes. Here, the amount of water from the source is infinite. Also, any funnels exposed to the water continue to experience the water even as it passes into successive funnels. The non-conserved model is the most suitable for explaining the transmission of most infectious diseases.\nThe SIR model\n[edit]In 1927, W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick created a model in which they considered a fixed population with only three compartments, susceptible: , infected, , and recovered, . The compartments used for this model consist of three classes:\n- is used to represent the number of individuals not yet infected with the disease at time t, or those susceptible to the disease\n- denotes the number of individuals who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to those in the susceptible category\n- is the compartment used for those individuals who have been infected and then recovered from the disease. Those in this category are not able to be infected again or to transmit the infection to others.\nThe flow of this model may be considered as follows:\nUsing a fixed population, , Kermack and McKendrick derived the following equations:\nSeveral assumptions were made in the formulation of these equations: First, an individual in the population must be considered as having an equal probability as every other individual of contracting the disease with a rate of , which is considered the contact or infection rate of the disease. Therefore, an infected individual makes contact and is able to transmit the disease with others per unit time and the fraction of contacts by an infected with a susceptible is . The number of new infections in unit time per infective then is , giving the rate of new infections (or those leaving the susceptible category) as (Brauer & Castillo-Chavez, 2001). For the second and third equations, consider the population leaving the susceptible class as equal to the number entering the infected class. However, infectives are leaving this class per unit time to enter the recovered/removed class at a rate per unit time (where represents the mean recovery rate, or the mean infective period). These processes which occur simultaneously are referred to as the Law of Mass Action, a widely accepted idea that the rate of contact between two groups in a population is proportional to the size of each of the groups concerned (Daley & Gani, 2005). Finally, it is assumed that the rate of infection and recovery is much faster than the time scale of births and deaths and therefore, these factors are ignored in this model.\nMore can be read on this model on the Epidemic model page.\nThe master equation approach\n[edit]A master equation can express the behaviour of an undirected growing network where, at each time step, a new node is added to the network, linked to an old node (randomly chosen and without preference). The initial network is formed by two nodes and two links between them at time , this configuration is necessary only to simplify further calculations, so at time the network have nodes and links.\nThe master equation for this network is:\nwhere is the probability to have the node with degree at time , and is the time step when this node was added to the network. Note that there are only two ways for an old node to have links at time :\n- The node have degree at time and will be linked by the new node with probability\n- Already has degree at time and will not be linked by the new node.\nAfter simplifying this model, the degree distribution is [49]\nBased on this growing network, an epidemic model is developed following a simple rule: Each time the new node is added and after choosing the old node to link, a decision is made: whether or not this new node will be infected. The master equation for this epidemic model is:\nwhere represents the decision to infect () or not (). Solving this master equation, the following solution is obtained: [50]\nMultilayer networks\n[edit]Multilayer networks are networks with multiple kinds of relations.[51] Attempts to model real-world systems as multidimensional networks have been used in various fields such as social network analysis,[52] economics, history, urban and international transport, ecology, psychology, medicine, biology, commerce, climatology, physics, computational neuroscience, operations management, and finance.\nNetwork optimization\n[edit]Network problems that involve finding an optimal way of doing something are studied under the name of combinatorial optimization. Examples include network flow, shortest path problem, transport problem, transshipment problem, location problem, matching problem, assignment problem, packing problem, routing problem, critical path analysis and PERT (Program Evaluation & Review Technique).\nInterdependent networks\n[edit]Interdependent networks are networks where the functioning of nodes in one network depends on the functioning of nodes in another network. In nature, networks rarely appear in isolation, rather, usually networks are typically elements in larger systems, and interact with elements in that complex system. Such complex dependencies can have non-trivial effects on one another. A well studied example is the interdependency of infrastructure networks,[53] the power stations which form the nodes of the power grid require fuel delivered via a network of roads or pipes and are also controlled via the nodes of communications network. Though the transportation network does not depend on the power network to function, the communications network does. In such infrastructure networks, the disfunction of a critical number of nodes in either the power network or the communication network can lead to cascading failures across the system with potentially catastrophic result to the whole system functioning.[54] If the two networks were treated in isolation, this important feedback effect would not be seen and predictions of network robustness would be greatly overestimated.\nSee also\n[edit]- Cascading failure\n- Climate as complex networks\n- Collaborative innovation network\n- Communicative ecology\n- Complex network\n- Core-periphery structures in networks\n- Dual-phase evolution\n- Erdős–Rényi model\n- Glossary of graph theory\n- Gradient network\n- Higher category theory\n- Immune network theory\n- Irregular warfare\n- Network analyzer\n- Network dynamics\n- Network formation\n- Network theory in risk assessment\n- Network topology\n- Networks in labor economics\n- Non-linear preferential attachment\n- Percolation\n- Percolation theory\n- Policy network analysis\n- Polytely\n- Quantum complex network\n- Random networks\n- Rumor spread in social network\n- Scale-free networks\n- Sequential dynamical system\n- Service network\n- Small-world networks\n- Structural cut-off\n- Systems theory\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Committee on Network Science for Future Army Applications (2006).

(December 2025) |\n| Part of a series on | ||||\n| Network science | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Network types | ||||\n| Graphs | ||||\n|\n||||\n| Models | ||||\n|\n||||\n| ||||\nIn mathematics, computer science, and network science, network theory is a part of graph theory. It defines networks as graphs where the vertices or edges possess attributes. Network theory analyses these networks over the symmetric relations or asymmetric relations between their (discrete) components.\nNetwork theory has applications in many disciplines, including statistical physics, particle physics, computer science, electrical engineering,[1][2] biology,[3] archaeology,[4] linguistics,[5][6][7] economics,[8] finance, operations research, climatology, ecology, public health,[9][10][11] sociology,[12] psychology,[13] and neuroscience.[14][15][16] Applications of network theory include logistical networks, the World Wide Web, Internet, gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, social networks, epistemological networks, etc.; see List of network theory topics for more examples.\nEuler's solution of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem is considered to be the first true proof in the theory of networks.\nNetwork optimization\n[edit]Network problems that involve finding an optimal way of doing something are studied as combinatorial optimization. Examples include network flow, shortest path problem, transport problem, transshipment problem, location problem, matching problem, assignment problem, packing problem, routing problem, critical path analysis, and program evaluation and review technique.\nNetwork analysis\n[edit]Electric network analysis\n[edit]The analysis of electric power systems could be conducted using network theory from two main points of view:\n- An abstract perspective (i.e., as a graph consists from nodes and edges), regardless of the electric power aspects (e.g., transmission line impedances). Most of these studies focus only on the abstract structure of the power grid using node degree distribution and betweenness distribution, which introduces substantial insight regarding the vulnerability assessment of the grid. Through these types of studies, the category of the grid structure could be identified from the complex network perspective (e.g., single-scale, scale-free). This classification might help the electric power system engineers in the planning stage or while upgrading the infrastructure (e.g., add a new transmission line) to maintain a proper redundancy level in the transmission system.[1]\n- Weighted graphs that blend an abstract understanding of complex network theories and electric power systems properties.[2]\nSocial network analysis\n[edit]Social network analysis examines the structure of relationships between social entities.[18] These entities are often persons, but may also be groups, organizations, nation states, web sites, or scholarly publications.\nSince the 1970s, the empirical study of networks has played a central role in social science, and many of the mathematical and statistical tools used for studying networks have been first developed in sociology.[19] Amongst many other applications, social network analysis has been used to understand the diffusion of innovations, news and rumors.[20] Similarly, it has been used to examine the spread of both diseases and health-related behaviors.[21] It has also been applied to the study of markets, where it has been used to examine the role of trust in exchange relationships and of social mechanisms in setting prices.[22] It has been used to study recruitment into political movements, armed groups, and other social organizations.[23] It has also been used to conceptualize scientific disagreements[24] as well as academic prestige.[25] More recently, network analysis (and its close cousin traffic analysis) has gained a significant use in military intelligence.[26]\nBiological network analysis\n[edit]With the recent explosion of publicly available high throughput biological data, the analysis of molecular networks has gained significant interest.[27] The type of analysis in this context is closely related to social network analysis, but often focusing on local patterns in the network. For example, network motifs are small subgraphs that are over-represented in the network. Similarly, activity motifs are patterns in the attributes of nodes and edges in the network that are over-represented given the network structure. Using networks to analyze patterns in biological systems, such as food-webs, allows us to visualize the nature and strength of interactions between species. The analysis of biological networks with respect to diseases has led to the development of the field of network medicine.[28] Recent examples of application of network theory in biology include applications to understanding the cell cycle[29] as well as a quantitative framework for developmental processes.[30]\nNarrative network analysis\n[edit]The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale. The resulting narrative networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.[32] This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis,[33] whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.[31]\nLink analysis\n[edit]Link analysis is a subset of network analysis, exploring associations between objects. An example may be examining the addresses of suspects and victims, the telephone numbers they have dialed, and financial transactions that they have partaken in during a given timeframe, and the familial relationships between these subjects as a part of police investigation. Link analysis here provides the crucial relationships and associations between very many objects of different types that are not apparent from isolated pieces of information. Computer-assisted or fully automatic computer-based link analysis is increasingly employed by banks and insurance agencies in fraud detection, by telecommunication operators in telecommunication network analysis, by medical sector in epidemiology and pharmacology, in law enforcement investigations, by search engines for relevance rating (and conversely by the spammers for spamdexing and by business owners for search engine optimization), and everywhere else where relationships between many objects have to be analyzed. Links are also derived from similarity of time behavior in both nodes. Examples include climate networks where the links between two locations (nodes) are determined, for example, by the similarity of the rainfall or temperature fluctuations in both sites.[34][35]\nWeb link analysis\n[edit]Several Web search ranking algorithms use link-based centrality metrics, including Google's PageRank, Kleinberg's HITS algorithm, the CheiRank and TrustRank algorithms. Link analysis is also conducted in information science and communication science in order to understand and extract information from the structure of collections of web pages. For example, the analysis might be of the interlinking between politicians' websites or blogs. Another use is for classifying pages according to their mention in other pages.[36]\nCentrality measures\n[edit]Information about the relative importance of nodes and edges in a graph can be obtained through centrality measures, widely used in disciplines like sociology. For example, eigenvector centrality uses the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix corresponding to a network, to determine nodes that tend to be frequently visited. Formally established measures of centrality are degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, subgraph centrality, and Katz centrality. The purpose or objective of analysis generally determines the type of centrality measure to be used. For example, if one is interested in dynamics on networks or the robustness of a network to node/link removal, often the dynamical importance[37] of a node is the most relevant centrality measure.\nAssortative and disassortative mixing\n[edit]These concepts are used to characterize the linking preferences of hubs in a network. Hubs are nodes which have a large number of links. Some hubs tend to link to other hubs while others avoid connecting to hubs and prefer to connect to nodes with low connectivity. We say a hub is assortative when it tends to connect to other hubs. A disassortative hub avoids connecting to other hubs. If hubs have connections with the expected random probabilities, they are said to be neutral. There are three methods to quantify degree correlations.[38]\nRecurrence networks\n[edit]The recurrence matrix of a recurrence plot can be considered as the adjacency matrix of an undirected and unweighted network. This allows for the analysis of time series by network measures. Applications range from detection of regime changes over characterizing dynamics to synchronization analysis.[39][40][41]\nSpatial networks\n[edit]Many real networks are embedded in space. Examples include, transportation and other infrastructure networks, brain neural networks. Several models for spatial networks have been developed.[42]\nTemporal networks\n[edit]Other networks emphasise the evolution over time of systems of nodes and their interconnections. Temporal networks are used for example to study how financial risk has spread across countries.[43] In this study, temporal networks are used to also visually trace the intricate dynamics of financial contagion during crises. Unlike traditional network approaches that aggregate or analyze static snapshots, the study uses a time-respecting path methodology to preserve the sequence and timing of financial crises contagion events. This enables the identification of nodes as sources, transmitters, or receivers of financial stress, avoiding mischaracterizations inherent in static or aggregated methods. Following this approach, banks are found to serve as key intermediaries in contagion paths, and temporal analysis pinpoints smaller countries like Greece and Italy as significant origins of shocks during crises—insights obscured by static approaches that overemphasize large economies like the US or Japan.\nTemporal networks can also be used to explore how cooperation evolves in dynamic, real-world population structures where interactions are time-dependent.[44] Here the authors find that network temporality enhances cooperation compared to static networks, even though \"bursty\" interaction patterns typically hinder it. This finding also shows how cooperation and other emergent behaviours can thrive in realistic, time-varying population structures, challenging conventional assumptions rooted in static models.\nIn psychology, temporal networks enable the understanding of psychological disorders by framing them as dynamic systems of interconnected symptoms rather than outcomes of a single underlying cause. Using \"nodes\" to represent symptoms and \"edges\" to signify their direct interactions, symptoms like insomnia and fatigue are shown how they influence each other over time; also, disorders such as depression are shown not to be fixed entities but evolving networks, where identifying \"bridge symptoms\" like concentration difficulties can explain comorbidity between conditions such as depression and anxiety.[45]\nLastly, temporal networks enable a better understanding and controlling of the spread of infectious diseases.[46] Unlike traditional static networks, which assume continuous, unchanging connections, temporal networks account for the precise timing and duration of interactions between individuals. This dynamic approach reveals critical nuances, such as how diseases can spread via time-sensitive pathways that static models miss. Temporal data, such as interactions captured through Bluetooth sensors or in hospital wards, can improve predictions of outbreak speed and extent. Overlooking temporal correlations can lead to significant errors in estimating epidemic dynamics, emphasizing the need for a temporal framework to develop more accurate strategies for disease control.\nSpread\n[edit]Content in a complex network can spread via two major methods: conserved spread and non-conserved spread.[47] In conserved spread, the total amount of content that enters a complex network remains constant as it passes through. The model of conserved spread can best be represented by a pitcher containing a fixed amount of water being poured into a series of funnels connected by tubes. Here, the pitcher represents the original source and the water is the content being spread. The funnels and connecting tubing represent the nodes and the connections between nodes, respectively. As the water passes from one funnel into another, the water disappears instantly from the funnel that was previously exposed to the water. In non-conserved spread, the amount of content changes as it enters and passes through a complex network. The model of non-conserved spread can best be represented by a continuously running faucet running through a series of funnels connected by tubes. Here, the amount of water from the original source is infinite. Also, any funnels that have been exposed to the water continue to experience the water even as it passes into successive funnels. The non-conserved model is the most suitable for explaining the transmission of most infectious diseases, neural excitation, information and rumors, etc.\nNetwork immunization\n[edit]The question of how to immunize efficiently scale free networks which represent realistic networks such as the Internet and social networks has been studied extensively. One such strategy is to immunize the largest degree nodes, i.e., targeted (intentional) attacks[48] since for this case is relatively high and fewer nodes are needed to be immunized. However, in most realistic networks the global structure is not available and the largest degree nodes are unknown.\nSee also\n[edit]- Actor-network theory\n- Complex network\n- Complex system\n- Systems thinking\n- Congestion game\n- Quantum complex network\n- Dual-phase evolution\n- Network partition\n- Network science\n- Network theory in risk assessment\n- Network topology\n- Network analyzer\n- Seven Bridges of Königsberg\n- Small-world networks\n- Social network\n- Scale-free networks\n- Network dynamics\n- Sequential dynamical systems\n- Pathfinder networks\n- Human disease network\n- Biological network\n- Network medicine\n- Graph partition\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b Borchers A, Pieler T (November 2010). \"Programming pluripotent precursor cells derived from Xenopus embryos to generate specific tissues and organs\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)", "title": "Graph (discrete mathematics) - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Graph (discrete mathematics)\nIn discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory, a graph is a structure consisting of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are in some sense \"related\". The objects are represented by abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line).[1] Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.\nThe edges may be directed or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent people at a party, and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person B only if B also shakes hands with A. In contrast, if an edge from a person A to a person B means that A owes money to B, then this graph is directed, because owing money is not necessarily reciprocated.\nGraphs are the basic subject studied by graph theory. The word \"graph\" was first used in this sense by J. J. Sylvester in 1878 due to a direct relation between mathematics and chemical structure (what he called a chemico-graphical image).[2][3]\nDefinitions\n[edit]Definitions in graph theory vary. The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures.\nGraph\n[edit]A graph (sometimes called an undirected graph to distinguish it from a directed graph, or a simple graph to distinguish it from a multigraph)[4][5] is a pair G = (V, E), where V is a set whose elements are called vertices (singular: vertex), and E is a set of unordered pairs of vertices, whose elements are called edges (sometimes links or lines).\nThe vertices u and v of an edge {u, v} are called the edge's endpoints. The edge is said to join u and v and to be incident on them. A vertex may belong to no edge, in which case it is not joined to any other vertex and is called isolated. When an edge exists, the vertices u and v are called adjacent.\nA multigraph is a generalization that allows multiple edges to have the same pair of endpoints. In some texts, multigraphs are simply called graphs.[6][7]\nSometimes, graphs are allowed to contain loops, which are edges that join a vertex to itself. To allow loops, the pairs of vertices in E must be allowed to have the same node twice. Such generalized graphs are called graphs with loops or simply graphs when it is clear from the context that loops are allowed.\nGenerally, the vertex set V is taken to be finite (which implies that the edge set E is also finite). Sometimes infinite graphs are considered, but they are usually viewed as a special kind of binary relation, because most results on finite graphs either do not extend to the infinite case or need a rather different proof.\nAn empty graph is a graph that has an empty set of vertices (and thus an empty set of edges). The order of a graph is its number |V| of vertices, usually denoted by n. The size of a graph is its number |E| of edges, typically denoted by m. However, in some contexts, such as for expressing the computational complexity of algorithms, the term size is used for the quantity |V| + |E| (otherwise, a non-empty graph could have size 0). The degree or valency of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to it; for graphs with loops, a loop is counted twice.\nIn a graph of order n, the maximum degree of each vertex is n − 1 (or n + 1 if loops are allowed, because a loop contributes 2 to the degree), and the maximum number of edges is n(n − 1)/2 (or n(n + 1)/2 if loops are allowed).\nThe edges of a graph define a symmetric relation on the vertices, called the adjacency relation. Specifically, two vertices x and y are adjacent if {x, y} is an edge. A graph is fully determined by its adjacency matrix A, which is an n × n square matrix, with Aij specifying the number of connections from vertex i to vertex j. For a simple graph, Aij is either 0, indicating disconnection, or 1, indicating connection; moreover Aii = 0 because an edge in a simple graph cannot start and end at the same vertex. Graphs with self-loops will be characterized by some or all Aii being equal to a positive integer, and multigraphs (with multiple edges between vertices) will be characterized by some or all Aij being equal to a positive integer. Undirected graphs will have a symmetric adjacency matrix (meaning Aij = Aji).\nDirected graph\n[edit]A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations.\nIn one restricted but very common sense of the term,[8] a directed graph is a pair G = (V, E) comprising:\n- V, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points);\n- E, a set of edges (also called directed edges, directed links, directed lines, arrows, or arcs), which are ordered pairs of distinct vertices: .\nTo avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed simple graph.\nIn the edge (x, y) directed from x to y, the vertices x and y are called the endpoints of the edge, x the tail of the edge and y the head of the edge. The edge is said to join x and y and to be incident on x and on y. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. The edge (y, x) is called the inverted edge of (x, y). Multiple edges, not allowed under the definition above, are two or more edges with both the same tail and the same head.\nIn one more general sense of the term allowing multiple edges,[8] a directed graph is sometimes defined to be an ordered triple G = (V, E, ϕ) comprising:\n- V, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points);\n- E, a set of edges (also called directed edges, directed links, directed lines, arrows or arcs);\n- ϕ, an incidence function mapping every edge to an ordered pair of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices): .\nTo avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed multigraph.\nA loop is an edge that joins a vertex to itself. Directed graphs as defined in the two definitions above cannot have loops, because a loop joining a vertex to itself is the edge (for a directed simple graph) or is incident on (for a directed multigraph) which is not in . So to allow loops the definitions must be expanded. For directed simple graphs, the definition of should be modified to . For directed multigraphs, the definition of should be modified to . To avoid ambiguity, these types of objects may be called precisely a directed simple graph permitting loops and a directed multigraph permitting loops (or a quiver) respectively.\nThe edges of a directed simple graph permitting loops G is a homogeneous relation ~ on the vertices of G that is called the adjacency relation of G. Specifically, for each edge (x, y), its endpoints x and y are said to be adjacent to one another, which is denoted x ~ y.\nMixed graph\n[edit]A mixed graph is a graph in which some edges may be directed and some may be undirected. It is an ordered triple G = (V, E, A) for a mixed simple graph and G = (V, E, A, ϕE, ϕA) for a mixed multigraph with V, E (the undirected edges), A (the directed edges), ϕE and ϕA defined as above. Directed and undirected graphs are special cases.\nWeighted graph\n[edit]A weighted graph or a network[9][10] is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge.[11] Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem.\nTypes of graphs\n[edit]Oriented graph\n[edit]One definition of an oriented graph is that it is a directed graph in which at most one of (x, y) and (y, x) may be edges of the graph. That is, it is a directed graph that can be formed as an orientation of an undirected (simple) graph.\nSome authors use \"oriented graph\" to mean the same as \"directed graph\". Some authors use \"oriented graph\" to mean any orientation of a given undirected graph or multigraph.\nRegular graph\n[edit]A regular graph is a graph in which each vertex has the same number of neighbours, i.e., every vertex has the same degree. A regular graph with vertices of degree k is called a k‑regular graph or regular graph of degree k.\nComplete graph\n[edit]A complete graph is a graph in which each pair of vertices is joined by an edge. A complete graph contains all possible edges.\nFinite graph\n[edit]A finite graph is a graph in which the vertex set and the edge set are finite sets. Otherwise, it is called an infinite graph.\nMost commonly in graph theory it is implied that the graphs discussed are finite. If the graphs are infinite, that is usually specifically stated.\nConnected graph\n[edit]In an undirected graph, an unordered pair of vertices {x, y} is called connected if a path leads from x to y. Otherwise, the unordered pair is called disconnected.\nA connected graph is an undirected graph in which every unordered pair of vertices in the graph is connected. Otherwise, it is called a disconnected graph.\nIn a directed graph, an ordered pair of vertices (x, y) is called strongly connected if a directed path leads from x to y. Otherwise, the ordered pair is called weakly connected if an undirected path leads from x to y after replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges. Otherwise, the ordered pair is called disconnected.\nA strongly connected graph is a directed graph in which every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is strongly connected. Otherwise, it is called a weakly connected graph if every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is weakly connected. Otherwise it is called a disconnected graph.\nA k-vertex-connected graph or k-edge-connected graph is a graph in which no set of k − 1 vertices (respectively, edges) exists that, when removed, disconnects the graph. A k-vertex-connected graph is often called simply a k-connected graph.\nBipartite graph\n[edit]A bipartite graph is a simple graph in which the vertex set can be partitioned into two sets, W and X, so that no two vertices in W share a common edge and no two vertices in X share a common edge. Alternatively, it is a graph with a chromatic number of 2.\nIn a complete bipartite graph, the vertex set is the union of two disjoint sets, W and X, so that every vertex in W is adjacent to every vertex in X but there are no edges within W or X.\nPath graph\n[edit]A path graph or linear graph of order n ≥ 2 is a graph in which the vertices can be listed in an order v1, v2, …, vn such that the edges are the {vi, vi+1} where i = 1, 2, …, n − 1. Path graphs can be characterized as connected graphs in which the degree of all but two vertices is 2 and the degree of the two remaining vertices is 1. If a path graph occurs as a subgraph of another graph, it is a path in that graph.\nPlanar graph\n[edit]A planar graph is a graph whose vertices and edges can be drawn in a plane such that no two of the edges intersect.\nCycle graph\n[edit]A cycle graph or circular graph of order n ≥ 3 is a graph in which the vertices can be listed in an order v1, v2, …, vn such that the edges are the {vi, vi+1} where i = 1, 2, …, n − 1, plus the edge {vn, v1}. Cycle graphs can be characterized as connected graphs in which the degree of all vertices is 2. If a cycle graph occurs as a subgraph of another graph, it is a cycle or circuit in that graph.\nTree\n[edit]A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph.\nA forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by at most one path, or equivalently an acyclic undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.\nPolytree\n[edit]A polytree (or directed tree or oriented tree or singly connected network) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree.\nA polyforest (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest.\nAdvanced classes\n[edit]More advanced kinds of graphs are:\n- Petersen graph and its generalizations;\n- perfect graphs;\n- cographs;\n- chordal graphs;\n- other graphs with large automorphism groups: vertex-transitive, arc-transitive, and distance-transitive graphs;\n- strongly regular graphs and their generalizations distance-regular graphs.\nProperties of graphs\n[edit]Two vertices of a graph are called adjacent if they share a common edge. Two vertices of a directed graph are called consecutive if the head of the first one is the tail of the second one. Similarly, two vertices are called adjacent if they share a common edge (consecutive if the first one is the tail and the second one is the head of an edge), in which case the common edge is said to join the two vertices. An edge and a vertex on that edge are called incident.\nThe graph with only one vertex and no edges is called the trivial graph. A graph with only vertices and no edges is known as an edgeless graph. The graph with no vertices and no edges is sometimes called the null graph or empty graph, but the terminology is not consistent and not all mathematicians allow this object.\nNormally, the vertices of a graph, by their nature as elements of a set, are distinguishable. This kind of graph may be called vertex-labeled. However, for many questions it is better to treat vertices as indistinguishable. (Of course, the vertices may be still distinguishable by the properties of the graph itself, e.g., by the numbers of incident edges.) The same remarks apply to edges, so graphs with labeled edges are called edge-labeled. Graphs with labels attached to edges or vertices are more generally designated as labeled. Consequently, graphs in which vertices are indistinguishable and edges are indistinguishable are called unlabeled. (In the literature, the term labeled may apply to other kinds of labeling, besides that which serves only to distinguish different vertices or edges.)\nThe category of directed multigraphs permitting loops is the comma category Set ↓ D where D: Set → Set is the functor taking a set s to s × s.\nExamples\n[edit]- The diagram is a schematic representation of the graph with vertices and edges\n- In computer science, directed graphs are used to represent knowledge (e.g., conceptual graph), finite-state machines, and many other discrete structures.\n- A binary relation R on a set X defines a directed graph. An element x of X is a direct predecessor of an element y of X if and only if xRy.\n- A directed graph can model information networks such as Twitter, with one user following another.[12][13]\n- Particularly regular examples of directed graphs are given by the Cayley graphs of finitely-generated groups, as well as Schreier coset graphs\n- In category theory, every small category has an underlying directed multigraph whose vertices are the objects of the category, and whose edges are the arrows of the category. In the language of category theory, one says that there is a forgetful functor from the category of small categories to the category of quivers.\nGraph operations\n[edit]There are several operations that produce new graphs from initial ones, which might be classified into the following categories:\n- unary operations, which create a new graph from an initial one, such as:\n- binary operations, which create a new graph from two initial ones, such as:\nGeneralizations\n[edit]In a hypergraph, an edge can join any positive number of vertices.\nAn undirected graph can be seen as a simplicial complex consisting of 1-simplices (the edges) and 0-simplices (the vertices). As such, complexes are generalizations of graphs since they allow for higher-dimensional simplices.\nEvery graph gives rise to a matroid.\nIn model theory, a graph is just a structure. But in that case, there is no limitation on the number of edges: it can be any cardinal number, see continuous graph.\nIn computational biology, power graph analysis introduces power graphs as an alternative representation of undirected graphs.\nIn geographic information systems, geometric networks are closely modeled after graphs, and borrow many concepts from graph theory to perform spatial analysis on road networks or utility grids.\nSee also\n[edit]- Conceptual graph\n- Graph (abstract data type)\n- Graph database\n- Graph drawing\n- List of graph theory topics\n- List of publications in graph theory\n- Network theory\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ Trudeau, Richard J.

The study of complex networks is a young and active area of scientific research[1][2] (since 2000) inspired largely by empirical findings of real-world networks such as computer networks, biological networks, technological networks, brain networks,[3][4] climate networks[5] and social networks.[6]\nDefinition\n[edit]Most social, biological, and technological networks display substantial non-trivial topological features, with patterns of connection between their elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random. Such features include a heavy tail in the degree distribution, a high clustering coefficient, assortativity or disassortativity among vertices, community structure, and hierarchical structure. In the case of directed networks these features also include reciprocity, triad significance profile and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as lattices and random graphs, do not show these features. The most complex structures can be realized by networks with a medium number of interactions.[7] This corresponds to the fact that the maximum information content (entropy) is obtained for medium probabilities.\nTwo well-known and much studied classes of complex networks are scale-free networks[8] and small-world networks,[9][10] whose discovery and definition are canonical case-studies in the field. Both are characterized by specific structural features—power-law degree distributions for the former and short path lengths and high clustering for the latter. However, as the study of complex networks has continued to grow in importance and popularity, many other aspects of network structures have attracted attention as well.\nThe field continues to develop at a brisk pace, and has brought together researchers from many areas including mathematics, physics, electric power systems,[11] biology, climate, computer science, sociology, epidemiology, and others.[12] Ideas and tools from network science and engineering have been applied to the analysis of metabolic and genetic regulatory networks; the study of ecosystem stability and robustness;[13] clinical science;[14] the modeling and design of scalable communication networks such as the generation and visualization of complex wireless networks;[15] and a broad range of other practical issues. Network science is the topic of many conferences in a variety of different fields, and has been the subject of numerous books both for the lay person and for the expert.\nScale-free networks\n[edit]A network is called scale-free[8][16] if its degree distribution, i.e., the probability that a node selected uniformly at random has a certain number of links (degree), follows a mathematical function called a power law. The power law implies that the degree distribution of these networks has no characteristic scale. In contrast, networks with a single well-defined scale are somewhat similar to a lattice in that every node has (roughly) the same degree. Examples of networks with a single scale include the Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graph, random regular graphs, regular lattices, and hypercubes. Some models of growing networks that produce scale-invariant degree distributions are the Barabási–Albert model and the fitness model. In a network with a scale-free degree distribution, some vertices have a degree that is orders of magnitude larger than the average - these vertices are often called \"hubs\", although this language is misleading as, by definition, there is no inherent threshold above which a node can be viewed as a hub. If there were such a threshold, the network would not be scale-free.\nInterest in scale-free networks began in the late 1990s with the reporting of discoveries of power-law degree distributions in real world networks such as the World Wide Web, the network of Autonomous systems (ASs), some networks of Internet routers, protein interaction networks, email networks, etc. Most of these reported \"power laws\" fail when challenged with rigorous statistical testing, but the more general idea of heavy-tailed degree distributions—which many of these networks do genuinely exhibit (before finite-size effects occur) -- are very different from what one would expect if edges existed independently and at random (i.e., if they followed a Poisson distribution). There are many different ways to build a network with a power-law degree distribution. The Yule process is a canonical generative process for power laws, and has been known since 1925. However, it is known by many other names due to its frequent reinvention, e.g., The Gibrat principle by Herbert A. Simon, the Matthew effect, cumulative advantage and, preferential attachment by Barabási and Albert for power-law degree distributions. Recently, Hyperbolic Geometric Graphs have been suggested as yet another way of constructing scale-free networks.\nSome networks with a power-law degree distribution (and specific other types of structure) can be highly resistant to the random deletion of vertices—i.e., the vast majority of vertices remain connected together in a giant component. Such networks can also be quite sensitive to targeted attacks aimed at fracturing the network quickly. When the graph is uniformly random except for the degree distribution, these critical vertices are the ones with the highest degree, and have thus been implicated in the spread of disease (natural and artificial) in social and communication networks, and in the spread of fads (both of which are modeled by a percolation or branching process). While random graphs (ER) have an average distance of order log N[9] between nodes, where N is the number of nodes, scale free graph can have a distance of log log N.\nSmall-world networks\n[edit]A network is called a small-world network[9] by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The small world hypothesis, which was first described by the Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy in 1929, and tested experimentally by Stanley Milgram (1967), is the idea that two arbitrary people are connected by only six degrees of separation, i.e. the diameter of the corresponding graph of social connections is not much larger than six. In 1998, Duncan J. Watts and Steven Strogatz published the first small-world network model, which through a single parameter smoothly interpolates between a random graph and a lattice.[9] Their model demonstrated that with the addition of only a small number of long-range links, a regular graph, in which the diameter is proportional to the size of the network, can be transformed into a \"small world\" in which the average number of edges between any two vertices is very small (mathematically, it should grow as the logarithm of the size of the network), while the clustering coefficient stays large. It is known that a wide variety of abstract graphs exhibit the small-world property, e.g., random graphs and scale-free networks. Further, real world networks such as the World Wide Web and the metabolic network also exhibit this property.\nIn the scientific literature on networks, there is some ambiguity associated with the term \"small world\". In addition to referring to the size of the diameter of the network, it can also refer to the co-occurrence of a small diameter and a high clustering coefficient. The clustering coefficient is a metric that represents the density of triangles in the network. For instance, sparse random graphs have a vanishingly small clustering coefficient while real world networks often have a coefficient significantly larger. Scientists point to this difference as suggesting that edges are correlated in real world networks. Approaches have been developed to generate network models that exhibit high correlations, while preserving the desired degree distribution and small-world properties. These approaches can be used to generate analytically solvable toy models for research into these systems.[17]\nSpatial networks\n[edit]Many real networks are embedded in space. Examples include, transportation and other infrastructure networks, brain networks.[3][4] Several models for spatial networks have been developed.[18]\nSee also\n[edit]- Community structure\n- Complex adaptive system\n- Complex systems\n- Dual-phase evolution\n- Dynamic network analysis\n- Interdependent networks\n- Multidimensional network\n- Network theory\n- Network science\n- Percolation theory\n- Random graph\n- Random graph theory of gelation\n- Scale-free networks\n- Small world networks\n- Spatial network\n- Trophic coherence\nBooks\n[edit]- Zinilli, A.

Please help improve it or discuss these issues on the talk page. (Learn how and when to remove these messages)\n|\nComplex contagion is the phenomenon in social networks in which multiple sources of exposure to an innovation are required before an individual adopts the change of behavior.[1] It differs from simple contagion in that unlike a disease, it may not be possible for the innovation to spread after only one incident of contact with an infected neighbor. The spread of complex contagion across a network of people may depend on many social and economic factors; for instance, how many of one's friends adopt the new idea as well as how many of them cannot influence the individual, as well as their own disposition in embracing change.\nMechanisms\n[edit]Complex Contagion and the Weakness of Long Ties by Damon Centola of University of Pennsylvania and Michael Macy of Cornell University found that information and disease spread as “simple contagions”, requiring only one contact for transmission, while behaviors typically spread as “complex contagions”, requiring multiples sources of reinforcement to induce adoption. Centola’s work builds on Granovetter’s work on the strength of weak ties and threshold models of collective behavior, as well as Duncan Watts and Steve Strogatz’s work on small world networks.[2] Centola and Macy show that the weak ties and small worlds networks are both very good for spreading simple contagions. However, for complex contagions, weak ties and small worlds can slow diffusion.\nCentola and Macy suggest four mechanisms of complex contagion. These properties explain the need for multiple exposures in the spread of contagion:\n- Coordination. Certain innovations become attractive only when people collectively adopt them. In his book \"Change,\" Centola discusses that social technologies like popular media-sharing platforms such as Twitter and Facebook only become valuable once a critical mass of individuals within your social network begins to use them. Many innovations are costly, especially for early adopters but less so for those who wait. The same holds for participation in collective action.\n- Credibility. Innovations often lack credibility until adopted by neighbors. Hearing the same story from different people makes it seem less likely that surprising information is nothing more than the fanciful invention of the informant.\n- Legitimacy. Knowing that a movement exists or that a collective action will take place is rarely sufficient to induce bystanders to join in. Having several close friends participate in an event often greatly increases an individual’s likelihood of also joining, especially for high-risk social movements. Innovators risk being shunned as deviants until there is a critical mass of early adopters, and non-adopters are likely to challenge the legitimacy of the innovation.\n- Emotional contagion. Most theoretical models of collective behavior – from action theory to threshold models to cybernetics share the basic assumption that there are expressive and symbolic impulses in human behavior that can be communicated and amplified in spatially and socially concentrated gatherings.[1]\nContested vs. uncontested\n[edit]- Uncontested\n- The spread of the contagion is dependent solely on the number of people you are connected to who are different from your own state. You are not hindered whatsoever by the number of people in the same state as you. Generally, the more neighbors an individual has, the greater the chance of the individual adopting the innovation if the spread is uncontested.[1]\n- Contested\n- The spread of the contagion is dependent on both the adamancy of those who are in a different state from your own as well as the countervailing influence of those who share your current state. In this case, the more neighbors an individual has, the smaller the chance of the individual adopting the innovation.[1]\nDiffusion and cascading behaviors in networks\n[edit]Consider a graph of any reasonable size. Node v’s neighbors can be split into two sets: Set A contains v's neighbors who have adopted a new behavior and B is the set of those behaving conservatively. Node v will only adopt the behavior of those in A if at least a q fraction of neighbors follow behavior A.[3]\n- if q is small, the behavior is easily adopted and easily spread\n- if q is large, B is an attractive behavior and it takes more friends to engage in A before v will switch.[3]\n- Cascading – diffusion over the entire network\n- Consider a set of initial adopters who start with a new behavior A, while every other node starts with behavior B. Nodes then repeatedly evaluate the decision to switch from B to A using a threshold of q. If the resulting cascade of adoptions of A eventually causes every node to switch from B to A, then we say that the set of initial adopters causes a complete cascade at threshold q. Clusters of density d > 1 − q are obstacles to cascades across the entire network.[3]\nApplication and examples\n[edit]Many interactions happen at a local, rather than a global, level – we often don't care as much about the full population's decisions as about the decisions made by friends and colleagues. For example, in a work setting we may choose technology to be compatible with the people we directly collaborate with, rather than the universally most popular technology. Similarly, we may adopt political views that are aligned with those of our friends, even if they belong to minorities.[3]\nExamples\n[edit]- The credibility of an urban legend\n- Willingness to participate in migration – (participating in a collective action)\n- Incentives to exit formal gatherings\n- Lifestyle trends: What clothing to wear, hairstyle to adopt, and what part of the body to pierce.[1]\n- The adoption of political hashtags on Twitter.

In an example of a social network, high clustering implies the high probability that two friends of one person are friends themselves. The low distances, on the other hand, mean that there is a short chain of social connections between any two people (this effect is known as six degrees of separation).[1] Specifically, a small-world network is defined to be a network where the typical distance L between two randomly chosen nodes (the number of steps required) grows proportionally to the logarithm of the number of nodes N in the network, that is:[2]\nwhile the global clustering coefficient is not small.\nIn the context of a social network, this results in the small world phenomenon of strangers being linked by a short chain of acquaintances. Many empirical graphs show the small-world effect, including social networks, wikis such as Wikipedia, gene networks, and even the underlying architecture of the Internet. It is the inspiration for many network-on-chip architectures in contemporary computer hardware.[3]\nA certain category of small-world networks were identified as a class of random graphs by Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz in 1998.[4] They noted that graphs could be classified according to two independent structural features, namely the clustering coefficient, and average node-to-node distance (also known as average shortest path length). Purely random graphs, built according to the Erdős–Rényi (ER) model, exhibit a small average shortest path length (varying typically as the logarithm of the number of nodes) along with a small clustering coefficient. Watts and Strogatz measured that in fact many real-world networks have a small average shortest path length, but also a clustering coefficient significantly higher than expected by random chance. Watts and Strogatz then proposed a novel graph model, currently named the Watts and Strogatz model, with (i) a small average shortest path length, and (ii) a large clustering coefficient. The crossover in the Watts–Strogatz model between a \"large world\" (such as a lattice) and a small world was first described by Barthelemy and Amaral in 1999.[5] This work was followed by many studies, including exact results (Barrat and Weigt, 1999; Dorogovtsev and Mendes; Barmpoutis and Murray, 2010).\nProperties of small-world networks\n[edit]Small-world networks tend to contain cliques, and near-cliques, meaning sub-networks which have connections between almost any two nodes within them. This follows from the defining property of a high clustering coefficient. Secondly, most pairs of nodes will be connected by at least one short path. This follows from the defining property that the mean-shortest path length be small. Several other properties are often associated with small-world networks. Typically there is an over-abundance of hubs – nodes in the network with a high number of connections (known as high degree nodes). These hubs serve as the common connections mediating the short path lengths between other edges. By analogy, the small-world network of airline flights has a small mean-path length (i.e. between any two cities you are likely to have to take three or fewer flights) because many flights are routed through hub cities. This property is often analyzed by considering the fraction of nodes in the network that have a particular number of connections going into them (the degree distribution of the network). Networks with a greater than expected number of hubs will have a greater fraction of nodes with high degree, and consequently the degree distribution will be enriched at high degree values. This is known colloquially as a fat-tailed distribution. Graphs of very different topology qualify as small-world networks as long as they satisfy the two definitional requirements above.\nNetwork small-worldness has been quantified by a small-coefficient, , calculated by comparing clustering and path length of a given network to an Erdős–Rényi model with same degree on average.[6][7]\n- if ( and ), network is small-world. However, this metric is known to perform poorly because it is heavily influenced by the network's size.[8][9]\nAnother method for quantifying network small-worldness utilizes the original definition of the small-world network comparing the clustering of a given network to an equivalent lattice network and its path length to an equivalent random network. The small-world measure () is defined as[8]\nWhere the characteristic path length L and clustering coefficient C are calculated from the network you are testing, Cℓ is the clustering coefficient for an equivalent lattice network and Lr is the characteristic path length for an equivalent random network.\nStill another method for quantifying small-worldness normalizes both the network's clustering and path length relative to these characteristics in equivalent lattice and random networks. The Small World Index (SWI) is defined as[9]\nBoth ω′ and SWI range between 0 and 1, and have been shown to capture aspects of small-worldness. However, they adopt slightly different conceptions of ideal small-worldness. For a given set of constraints (e.g. size, density, degree distribution), there exists a network for which ω′ = 1, and thus ω aims to capture the extent to which a network with given constraints as small worldly as possible. In contrast, there may not exist a network for which SWI = 1, thus SWI aims to capture the extent to which a network with given constraints approaches the theoretical small world ideal of a network where C ≈ Cℓ and L ≈ Lr.[9]\nExamples of small-world networks\n[edit]Small-world properties are found in many real-world phenomena, including websites with navigation menus, food webs, electric power grids, metabolite processing networks, networks of brain neurons, voter networks, telephone call graphs, and airport networks.[10] Cultural networks[11] and word co-occurrence networks[12] have also been shown to be small-world networks.\nNetworks of connected proteins have small world properties such as power-law obeying degree distributions.[13] Similarly transcriptional networks, in which the nodes are genes, and they are linked if one gene has an up or down-regulatory genetic influence on the other, have small world network properties.[14]\nExamples of non-small-world networks\n[edit]In another example, the famous theory of \"six degrees of separation\" between people tacitly presumes that the domain of discourse is the set of people alive at any one time. The number of degrees of separation between Albert Einstein and Alexander the Great is almost certainly greater than 30[15] and this network does not have small-world properties. A similarly constrained network would be the \"went to school with\" network: if two people went to the same college ten years apart from one another, it is unlikely that they have acquaintances in common amongst the student body.\nSimilarly, the number of relay stations through which a message must pass was not always small. In the days when the post was carried by hand or on horseback, the number of times a letter changed hands between its source and destination would have been much greater than it is today. The number of times a message changed hands in the days of the visual telegraph (circa 1800–1850) was determined by the requirement that two stations be connected by line-of-sight.\nTacit assumptions, if not examined, can cause a bias in the literature on graphs in favor of finding small-world networks (an example of the file drawer effect resulting from the publication bias).\nNetwork robustness\n[edit]It is hypothesized by some researchers, such as Albert-László Barabási, that the prevalence of small world networks in biological systems may reflect an evolutionary advantage of such an architecture. One possibility is that small-world networks are more robust to perturbations than other network architectures. If this were the case, it would provide an advantage to biological systems that are subject to damage by mutation or viral infection.\nIn a small world network with a degree distribution following a power-law, deletion of a random node rarely causes a dramatic increase in mean-shortest path length (or a dramatic decrease in the clustering coefficient). This follows from the fact that most shortest paths between nodes flow through hubs, and if a peripheral node is deleted it is unlikely to interfere with passage between other peripheral nodes. As the fraction of peripheral nodes in a small world network is much higher than the fraction of hubs, the probability of deleting an important node is very low. For example, if the small airport in Sun Valley, Idaho was shut down, it would not increase the average number of flights that other passengers traveling in the United States would have to take to arrive at their respective destinations. However, if random deletion of a node hits a hub by chance, the average path length can increase dramatically. This can be observed annually when northern hub airports, such as Chicago's O'Hare airport, are shut down because of snow; many people have to take additional flights.\nBy contrast, in a random network, in which all nodes have roughly the same number of connections, deleting a random node is likely to increase the mean-shortest path length slightly but significantly for almost any node deleted. In this sense, random networks are vulnerable to random perturbations, whereas small-world networks are robust. However, small-world networks are vulnerable to targeted attack of hubs, whereas random networks cannot be targeted for catastrophic failure.\nConstruction of small-world networks\n[edit]The main mechanism to construct small-world networks is the Watts–Strogatz mechanism.\nSmall-world networks can also be introduced with time-delay,[16] which will not only produce fractals but also chaos[17] under the right conditions, or transition to chaos in dynamics networks.[18]\nSoon after the publication of Watts–Strogatz mechanism, approaches have been developed by Mashaghi and co-workers to generate network models that exhibit high degree correlations, while preserving the desired degree distribution and small-world properties. These approaches are based on edge-dual transformation and can be used to generate analytically solvable small-world network models for research into these systems.[19]\nDegree–diameter graphs are constructed such that the number of neighbors each vertex in the network has is bounded, while the distance from any given vertex in the network to any other vertex (the diameter of the network) is minimized. Constructing such small-world networks is done as part of the effort to find graphs of order close to the Moore bound.\nAnother way to construct a small world network from scratch is given in Barmpoutis et al.,[20] where a network with very small average distance and very large average clustering is constructed. A fast algorithm of constant complexity is given, along with measurements of the robustness of the resulting graphs. Depending on the application of each network, one can start with one such \"ultra small-world\" network, and then rewire some edges, or use several small such networks as subgraphs to a larger graph.\nSmall-world properties can arise naturally in social networks and other real-world systems via the process of dual-phase evolution. This is particularly common where time or spatial constraints limit the addition of connections between vertices The mechanism generally involves periodic shifts between phases, with connections being added during a \"global\" phase and being reinforced or removed during a \"local\" phase.\nSmall-world networks can change from scale-free class to broad-scale class whose connectivity distribution has a sharp cutoff following a power law regime due to constraints limiting the addition of new links.[21] For strong enough constraints, scale-free networks can even become single-scale networks whose connectivity distribution is characterized as fast decaying.[21] It was also shown analytically that scale-free networks are ultra-small, meaning that the distance scales according to .[22]\nApplications\n[edit]Applications to sociology\n[edit]The advantages to small world networking for social movement groups are their resistance to change due to the filtering apparatus of using highly connected nodes, and its better effectiveness in relaying information while keeping the number of links required to connect a network to a minimum.[23]\nThe small world network model is directly applicable to affinity group theory represented in sociological arguments by William Finnegan. Affinity groups are social movement groups that are small and semi-independent pledged to a larger goal or function. Though largely unaffiliated at the node level, a few members of high connectivity function as connectivity nodes, linking the different groups through networking. This small world model has proven an extremely effective protest organization tactic against police action.[24] Clay Shirky argues that the larger the social network created through small world networking, the more valuable the nodes of high connectivity within the network.[23] The same can be said for the affinity group model, where the few people within each group connected to outside groups allowed for a large amount of mobilization and adaptation. A practical example of this is small world networking through affinity groups that William Finnegan outlines in reference to the 1999 Seattle WTO protests.\nApplications to earth sciences\n[edit]Many networks studied in geology and geophysics have been shown to have characteristics of small-world networks. Networks defined in fracture systems and porous substances have demonstrated these characteristics.[25] The seismic network in the Southern California region may be a small-world network.[26] The examples above occur on very different spatial scales, demonstrating the scale invariance of the phenomenon in the earth sciences.\nApplications to computing\n[edit]Small-world networks have been used to estimate the usability of information stored in large databases. The measure is termed the Small World Data Transformation Measure.[27][28] The greater the database links align to a small-world network the more likely a user is going to be able to extract information in the future. This usability typically comes at the cost of the amount of information that can be stored in the same repository.\nThe Freenet peer-to-peer network has been shown to form a small-world network in simulation,[29] allowing information to be stored and retrieved in a manner that scales efficiency as the network grows.\nNearest Neighbor Search solutions like HNSW use small-world networks to efficiently find the information in large item corpuses.[30][31]\nSmall-world neural networks in the brain\n[edit]Both anatomical connections in the brain[32] and the synchronization networks of cortical neurons[33] exhibit small-world topology.\nStructural and functional connectivity in the brain has also been found to reflect the small-world topology of short path length and high clustering.[34] The network structure has been found in the mammalian cortex across species as well as in large scale imaging studies in humans.[35] Advances in connectomics and network neuroscience, have found the small-worldness of neural networks to be associated with efficient communication.[36]\nIn neural networks, short pathlength between nodes and high clustering at network hubs supports efficient communication between brain regions at the lowest energetic cost.[36] The brain is constantly processing and adapting to new information and small-world network model supports the intense communication demands of neural networks.[37] High clustering of nodes forms local networks which are often functionally related. Short path length between these hubs supports efficient global communication.[38] This balance enables the efficiency of the global network while simultaneously equipping the brain to handle disruptions and maintain homeostasis, due to local subsystems being isolated from the global network.[39] Loss of small-world network structure has been found to indicate changes in cognition and increased risk of psychological disorders.[9]\nIn addition to characterizing whole-brain functional and structural connectivity, specific neural systems, such as the visual system, exhibit small-world network properties.[6]\nA small-world network of neurons can exhibit short-term memory. A computer model developed by Sara Solla[40][41] had two stable states, a property (called bistability) thought to be important in memory storage. An activating pulse generated self-sustaining loops of communication activity among the neurons. A second pulse ended this activity. The pulses switched the system between stable states: flow (recording a \"memory\"), and stasis (holding it). Small world neuronal networks have also been used as models to understand seizures.[42]\nSee also\n[edit]- Barabási–Albert model – Scale-free network generation algorithm\n- Climate as complex networks – Conceptual model to generate insight into climate science\n- Dual-phase evolution – Process that drives self-organization within complex adaptive systems\n- Dunbar's number – Suggested cognitive limit important in sociology and anthropology\n- Erdős number – Closeness of someone's association with mathematician Paul Erdős\n- Erdős–Rényi (ER) model – Two closely related models for generating random graphs\n- Local World Evolving Network Models\n- Percolation theory – Mathematical theory on behavior of connected clusters in a random graph\n- Network science – Academic field - mathematical theory of networks\n- Scale-free network – Network whose degree distribution follows a power law\n- Six degrees of Kevin Bacon – Parlor game on degrees of separation\n- Small-world experiment – Experiments examining the average path length for social networks\n- Social network – Social structure made up of a set of social actors\n- Watts–Strogatz model – Method of generating random small-world graphs\n- Network on a chip – Electronic communication subsystem on an integrated circuit – systems on chip modeled on small-world networks\n- Zachary's karate club\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Downey, Allen B.

That is, the fraction P(k) of nodes in the network having k connections to other nodes goes for large values of k as\nwhere is a parameter whose value is typically in the range (wherein the second moment (scale parameter) of is infinite but the first moment is finite), although occasionally it may lie outside these bounds.[1][2] The name \"scale-free\" could be explained by the fact that some moments of the degree distribution are not defined, so that the network does not have a characteristic scale or \"size\".\nPreferential attachment and the fitness model have been proposed as mechanisms to explain the power law degree distributions in real networks. Alternative models such as super-linear preferential attachment and second-neighbour preferential attachment may appear to generate transient scale-free networks, but the degree distribution deviates from a power law as networks become very large.[3][4]\nHistory\n[edit]In studies of citations between scientific papers, Derek de Solla Price showed in 1965 that the number of citations a paper receives had a heavy-tailed distribution following a Pareto distribution or power law. In a later paper in 1976, Price also proposed a mechanism to explain the occurrence of power laws in citation networks, which he called \"cumulative advantage.\" However, both treated citations are scalar quantities, rather than a fundamental feature of a new class of networks.\nThe interest in scale-free networks started in 1999 with work by Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert at the University of Notre Dame who mapped the topology of a portion of the World Wide Web,[5] finding that some nodes, which they called \"hubs\", had many more connections than others and that the network as a whole had a power-law distribution of the number of links connecting to a node. In a subsequent paper[6] Barabási and Albert showed that the power laws are not a unique property of the WWW, but the feature is present in a few real networks, prompting them to coin the term \"scale-free network\" to describe the class of networks that exhibit a power-law degree distribution.\nBarabási and Réka Albert proposed a generative mechanism[6] to explain the appearance of power-law distributions, which they called \"preferential attachment\". Analytic solutions for this mechanism were presented in 2000 by Dorogovtsev, Mendes and Samukhin[7] and independently by Krapivsky, Redner, and Leyvraz, and later rigorously proved by mathematician Béla Bollobás.[8]\nOverview\n[edit]When the concept of \"scale-free\" was initially introduced in the context of networks,[6] it primarily referred to a specific trait: a power-law distribution for a given variable , expressed as . This property maintains its form when subjected to a continuous scale transformation , evoking parallels with the renormalization group techniques in statistical field theory.[9][10]\nHowever, there's a key difference. In statistical field theory, the term \"scale\" often pertains to system size. In the realm of networks, \"scale\" is a measure of connectivity, generally quantified by a node's degree—that is, the number of links attached to it. Networks featuring a higher number of high-degree nodes are deemed to have greater connectivity.\nThe power-law degree distribution enables us to make \"scale-free\" assertions about the prevalence of high-degree nodes.[11] For instance, we can say that \"nodes with triple the average connectivity occur half as frequently as nodes with average connectivity\". The specific numerical value of what constitutes \"average connectivity\" becomes irrelevant, whether it's a hundred or a million.[12]\nCharacteristics\n[edit]The most notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of vertices with a degree that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called \"hubs\", and are thought to serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the domain. In a random network the maximum degree, or the expected largest hub, scales as kmax~ log N, where N is the network size, a very slow dependence. In contrast, in scale-free networks the largest hub scales as kmax~ ~N1/(γ−1) indicating that the hubs increase polynomically with the size of the network.\nA key feature of scale-free networks is their high degree heterogeneity, κ= <k2>/<k>, which governs multiple network-based processes, from network robustness to epidemic spreading and network synchronization. While for a random network κ= <k> + 1, i.e. the ration is independent of the network size N, for a scale-free network we have κ~ N(3−γ)/(γ−1), increasing with the network size, indicating that for these networks the degree heterogeneity increases.\nClustering\n[edit]Another important characteristic of scale-free networks is the clustering coefficient distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a power law. This implies that the low-degree nodes belong to very dense sub-graphs and those sub-graphs are connected to each other through hubs. Consider a social network in which nodes are people and links are acquaintance relationships between people. It is easy to see that people tend to form communities, i.e., small groups in which everyone knows everyone (one can think of such community as a complete graph). In addition, the members of a community also have a few acquaintance relationships to people outside that community. Some people, however, are connected to a large number of communities (e.g., celebrities, politicians). Those people may be considered the hubs responsible for the small-world phenomenon.\nAt present, the more specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the generative mechanism used to create them. For instance, networks generated by preferential attachment typically place the high-degree vertices in the middle of the network, connecting them together to form a core, with progressively lower-degree nodes making up the regions between the core and the periphery. The random removal of even a large fraction of vertices impacts the overall connectedness of the network very little, suggesting that such topologies could be useful for security, while targeted attacks destroys the connectedness very quickly. Other scale-free networks, which place the high-degree vertices at the periphery, do not exhibit these properties. Similarly, the clustering coefficient of scale-free networks can vary significantly depending on other topological details.\nImmunization\n[edit]The question of how to immunize efficiently scale free networks which represent realistic networks such as the Internet and social networks has been studied extensively. One such strategy is to immunize the largest degree nodes, i.e., targeted (intentional) attacks since for this case p is relatively high and less nodes are needed to be immunized. However, in many realistic cases the global structure is not available and the largest degree nodes are not known.\nProperties of random graph may change or remain invariant under graph transformations. Mashaghi A. et al., for example, demonstrated that a transformation which converts random graphs to their edge-dual graphs (or line graphs) produces an ensemble of graphs with nearly the same degree distribution, but with degree correlations and a significantly higher clustering coefficient. Scale free graphs, as such, remain scale free under such transformations.[13]\nExamples\n[edit]Examples of networks found to be scale-free include:\n- Some Social networks, including collaboration networks. Two examples that have been studied extensively are the collaboration of movie actors in films and the co-authorship by mathematicians of papers.\n- Many kinds of computer networks, including the internet and the webgraph of the World Wide Web.\n- Some financial networks such as interbank payment networks [14][15]\n- Protein–protein interaction networks.\n- Semantic networks.[16]\n- Airline networks.\nScale free topology has been also found in high temperature superconductors.[17] The qualities of a high-temperature superconductor — a compound in which electrons obey the laws of quantum physics, and flow in perfect synchrony, without friction — appear linked to the fractal arrangements of seemingly random oxygen atoms and lattice distortion.[18]\nGenerative models\n[edit]Scale-free networks do not arise by chance alone. Erdős and Rényi (1960) studied a model of growth for graphs in which, at each step, two nodes are chosen uniformly at random and a link is inserted between them. The properties of these random graphs are different from the properties found in scale-free networks, and therefore a model for this growth process is needed.\nThe most widely known generative model for a subset of scale-free networks is Barabási and Albert's (1999) rich get richer generative model in which each new Web page creates links to existing Web pages with a probability distribution which is not uniform, but proportional to the current in-degree of Web pages. According to this process, a page with many in-links will attract more in-links than a regular page. This generates a power-law but the resulting graph differs from the actual Web graph in other properties such as the presence of small tightly connected communities. More general models and network characteristics have been proposed and studied. For example, Pachon et al. (2018) proposed a variant of the rich get richer generative model which takes into account two different attachment rules: a preferential attachment mechanism and a uniform choice only for the most recent nodes.[19] For a review see the book by Dorogovtsev and Mendes.[citation needed] Some mechanisms such as super-linear preferential attachment and second neighbour attachment generate networks which are transiently scale-free, but deviate from a power law as networks grow large.[3][4]\nA somewhat different generative model for Web links has been suggested by Pennock et al. (2002). They examined communities with interests in a specific topic such as the home pages of universities, public companies, newspapers or scientists, and discarded the major hubs of the Web. In this case, the distribution of links was no longer a power law but resembled a normal distribution. Based on these observations, the authors proposed a generative model that mixes preferential attachment with a baseline probability of gaining a link.\nAnother generative model is the copy model studied by Kumar et al.[20] (2000), in which new nodes choose an existent node at random and copy a fraction of the links of the existent node. This also generates a power law.\nThere are two major components that explain the emergence of the power-law distribution in the Barabási–Albert model: the growth and the preferential attachment.[21] By \"growth\" is meant a growth process where, over an extended period of time, new nodes join an already existing system, a network (like the World Wide Web which has grown by billions of web pages over 10 years). Finally, by \"preferential attachment\" is meant that new nodes prefer to connect to nodes that already have a high number of links with others. Thus, there is a higher probability that more and more nodes will link themselves to that one which has already many links, leading this node to a hub in-fine.[6] Depending on the network, the hubs might either be assortative or disassortative. Assortativity would be found in social networks in which well-connected/famous people would tend to know better each other. Disassortativity would be found in technological (Internet, World Wide Web) and biological (protein interaction, metabolism) networks.[21]\nHowever, the growth of the networks (adding new nodes) is not a necessary condition for creating a scale-free network (see Dangalchev[22]). One possibility (Caldarelli et al. 2002) is to consider the structure as static and draw a link between vertices according to a particular property of the two vertices involved. Once specified the statistical distribution for these vertex properties (fitnesses), it turns out that in some circumstances also static networks develop scale-free properties.\nGeneralized scale-free model\n[edit]There has been a burst of activity in the modeling of scale-free complex networks. The recipe of Barabási and Albert[23] has been followed by several variations and generalizations[24][25][26][27][19] and the revamping of previous mathematical works.[28]\nIn today's terms, if a complex network has a power-law distribution of any of its metrics, it's generally considered a scale-free network. Similarly, any model with this feature is called a scale-free model.[11]\nFeatures\n[edit]Many real networks are (approximately) scale-free and hence require scale-free models to describe them. In Price's scheme, there are two ingredients needed to build up a scale-free model:\n1. Adding or removing nodes. Usually we concentrate on growing the network, i.e. adding nodes.\n2. Preferential attachment: The probability that new nodes will be connected to the \"old\" node.\nNote that some models (see Dangalchev[22] and Fitness model below) can work also statically, without changing the number of nodes. It should also be kept in mind that the fact that \"preferential attachment\" models give rise to scale-free networks does not prove that this is the mechanism underlying the evolution of real-world scale-free networks, as there might exist different mechanisms at work in real-world systems that nevertheless give rise to scaling.\nExamples\n[edit]There have been several attempts to generate scale-free network properties. Here are some examples:\nThe Barabási–Albert model\n[edit]The Barabási–Albert model, an undirected version of Price's model has a linear preferential attachment and adds one new node at every time step.\n(Note, another general feature of in real networks is that , i.e. there is a nonzero probability that a new node attaches to an isolated node. Thus in general has the form , where is the initial attractiveness of the node.)\nTwo-level network model\n[edit]Dangalchev (see [22]) builds a 2-L model by considering the importance of each of the neighbours of a target node in preferential attachment. The attractiveness of a node in the 2-L model depends not only on the number of nodes linked to it but also on the number of links in each of these nodes.\nwhere C is a coefficient between 0 and 1.\nA variant of the 2-L model, the k2 model, where first and second neighbour nodes contribute equally to a target node's attractiveness, demonstrates the emergence of transient scale-free networks.[4] In the k2 model, the degree distribution appears approximately scale-free as long as the network is relatively small, but significant deviations from the scale-free regime emerge as the network grows larger. This results in the relative attractiveness of nodes with different degrees changing over time, a feature also observed in real networks.\nNon-linear preferential attachment\n[edit]The Barabási–Albert model assumes that the probability that a node attaches to node is proportional to the degree of node . This assumption involves two hypotheses: first, that depends on , in contrast to random graphs in which , and second, that the functional form of is linear in .\nIn non-linear preferential attachment, the form of is not linear, and recent studies have demonstrated that the degree distribution depends strongly on the shape of the function\nKrapivsky, Redner, and Leyvraz[26] demonstrate that the scale-free nature of the network is destroyed for nonlinear preferential attachment. The only case in which the topology of the network is scale free is that in which the preferential attachment is asymptotically linear, i.e. as . In this case the rate equation leads to\nThis way the exponent of the degree distribution can be tuned to any value between 2 and .[clarification needed]\nHierarchical network model\n[edit]Hierarchical network models are, by design, scale free and have high clustering of nodes.[29]\nThe iterative construction leads to a hierarchical network. Starting from a fully connected cluster of five nodes, we create four identical replicas connecting the peripheral nodes of each cluster to the central node of the original cluster. From this, we get a network of 25 nodes (N = 25). Repeating the same process, we can create four more replicas of the original cluster – the four peripheral nodes of each one connect to the central node of the nodes created in the first step. This gives N = 125, and the process can continue indefinitely.\nFitness model\n[edit]The idea is that the link between two vertices is assigned not randomly with a probability p equal for all the couple of vertices. Rather, for every vertex j there is an intrinsic fitness xj and a link between vertex i and j is created with a probability .[30] In the case of World Trade Web it is possible to reconstruct all the properties by using as fitnesses of the country their GDP, and taking\nHyperbolic geometric graphs\n[edit]Assuming that a network has an underlying hyperbolic geometry, one can use the framework of spatial networks to generate scale-free degree distributions. This heterogeneous degree distribution then simply reflects the negative curvature and metric properties of the underlying hyperbolic geometry.[32]\nEdge dual transformation to generate scale free graphs with desired properties\n[edit]Starting with scale free graphs with low degree correlation and clustering coefficient, one can generate new graphs with much higher degree correlations and clustering coefficients by applying edge-dual transformation.[13]\nUniform-preferential-attachment model (UPA model)\n[edit]UPA model is a variant of the preferential attachment model (proposed by Pachon et al.) which takes into account two different attachment rules: a preferential attachment mechanism (with probability 1−p) that stresses the rich get richer system, and a uniform choice (with probability p) for the most recent nodes. This modification is interesting to study the robustness of the scale-free behavior of the degree distribution. It is proved analytically that the asymptotically power-law degree distribution is preserved.[19]\nScale-free ideal networks\n[edit]In the context of network theory a scale-free ideal network is a random network with a degree distribution following the scale-free ideal gas density distribution. These networks are able to reproduce city-size distributions and electoral results by unraveling the size distribution of social groups with information theory on complex networks when a competitive cluster growth process is applied to the network.[33][34] In models of scale-free ideal networks it is possible to demonstrate that Dunbar's number is the cause of the phenomenon known as the 'six degrees of separation'.\nNovel characteristics\n[edit]For a scale-free network with nodes and power-law exponent , the induced subgraph constructed by vertices with degrees larger than is a scale-free network with , almost surely.[35]\nThe scale-free metric\n[edit]On a theoretical level, refinements to the abstract definition of scale-free have been proposed. For example, Li et al. (2005) offered a potentially more precise \"scale-free metric\". Briefly, let G be a graph with edge set E, and denote the degree of a vertex (that is, the number of edges incident to ) by . Define\nThis is maximized when high-degree nodes are connected to other high-degree nodes. Now define\nwhere smax is the maximum value of s(H) for H in the set of all graphs with degree distribution identical to that of G. This gives a metric between 0 and 1, where a graph G with small S(G) is \"scale-rich\", and a graph G with S(G) close to 1 is \"scale-free\". This definition captures the notion of self-similarity implied in the name \"scale-free\".\nEstimating the power law exponent\n[edit]Estimating the power-law exponent of a scale-free network is typically done by using the maximum likelihood estimation with the degrees of a few uniformly sampled nodes.[36] However, since uniform sampling does not obtain enough samples from the important heavy-tail of the power law degree distribution, this method can yield a large bias and a variance. It has been recently proposed to sample random friends (i.e., random ends of random links) who are more likely come from the tail of the degree distribution as a result of the friendship paradox.[37][38] Theoretically, maximum likelihood estimation with random friends lead to a smaller bias and a smaller variance compared to classical approach based on uniform sampling.[38]\nSee also\n[edit]- Random graph – Graph generated by a random process\n- Erdős–Rényi model – Two closely related models for generating random graphs\n- Non-linear preferential attachment\n- Bose–Einstein condensation (network theory)\n- Scale invariance – Features that do not change if length or energy scales are multiplied by a common factor\n- Complex network – Network with non-trivial topological features\n- Webgraph – Graph of connected web pages\n- Barabási–Albert model – Scale-free network generation algorithm\n- Bianconi–Barabási model\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Onnela, J.-P.; Saramaki, J.; Hyvonen, J.; Szabo, G.; Lazer, D.; Kaski, K.; Kertesz, J.; Barabasi, A. -L.

In the particular case of non-overlapping community finding, this implies that the network divides naturally into groups of nodes with dense connections internally and sparser connections between groups. But overlapping communities are also allowed. The more general definition is based on the principle that pairs of nodes are more likely to be connected if they are both members of the same community(ies), and less likely to be connected if they do not share communities. A related but different problem is community search, where the goal is to find a community that a certain vertex belongs to.\nProperties\n[edit]In the study of networks, such as computer and information networks, social networks and biological networks, a number of different characteristics have been found to occur commonly, including the small-world property, heavy-tailed degree distributions, and clustering, among others. Another common characteristic is community structure.[1][2][3][4][5] In the context of networks, community structure refers to the occurrence of groups of nodes in a network that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network, as shown in the example image to the right. This inhomogeneity of connections suggests that the network has certain natural divisions within it.\nCommunities are often defined in terms of the partition of the set of vertices, that is each node is put into one and only one community, just as in the figure. This is a useful simplification and most community detection methods find this type of community structure. However, in some cases a better representation could be one where vertices are in more than one community. This might happen in a social network where each vertex represents a person, and the communities represent the different groups of friends: one community for family, another community for co-workers, one for friends in the same sports club, and so on. The use of cliques for community detection discussed below is just one example of how such overlapping community structure can be found.\nSome networks may not have any meaningful community structure. Many basic network models, for example, such as the random graph and the Barabási–Albert model, do not display community structure.\nImportance\n[edit]Community structures are quite common in real networks. Social networks include community groups (the origin of the term, in fact) based on common location, interests, occupation, etc.[5][6]\nFinding an underlying community structure in a network, if it exists, is important for a number of reasons. Communities allow us to create a large scale map of a network since individual communities act like meta-nodes in the network which makes its study easier.[7]\nIndividual communities also shed light on the function of the system represented by the network since communities often correspond to functional units of the system. In metabolic networks, such functional groups correspond to cycles or pathways whereas in the protein interaction network, communities correspond to proteins with similar functionality inside a biological cell. Similarly, citation networks form communities by research topic.[1] Being able to identify these sub-structures within a network can provide insight into how network function and topology affect each other. Such insight can be useful in improving some algorithms on graphs such as spectral clustering.[8]\nImportantly, communities often have very different properties than the average properties of the networks. Thus, only concentrating on the average properties usually misses many important and interesting features inside the networks. For example, in a given social network, both gregarious and reticent groups might exists simultaneously.[7]\nExistence of communities also generally affects various processes like rumour spreading or epidemic spreading happening on a network. Hence to properly understand such processes, it is important to detect communities and also to study how they affect the spreading processes in various settings.\nFinally, an important application that community detection has found in network science is the prediction of missing links and the identification of false links in the network. During the measurement process, some links may not get observed for a number of reasons. Similarly, some links could falsely enter into the data because of the errors in the measurement. Both these cases are well handled by community detection algorithm since it allows one to assign the probability of existence of an edge between a given pair of nodes.[9]\nAlgorithms for finding communities\n[edit]Finding communities within an arbitrary network can be a computationally difficult task. The number of communities, if any, within the network is typically unknown and the communities are often of unequal size and/or density. Despite these difficulties, however, several methods for community finding have been developed and employed with varying levels of success.[4]\nMinimum-cut method\n[edit]One of the oldest algorithms for dividing networks into parts is the minimum cut method (and variants such as ratio cut and normalized cut). This method sees use, for example, in load balancing for parallel computing in order to minimize communication between processor nodes.\nIn the minimum-cut method, the network is divided into a predetermined number of parts, usually of approximately the same size, chosen such that the number of edges between groups is minimized. The method works well in many of the applications for which it was originally intended but is less than ideal for finding community structure in general networks since it will find communities regardless of whether they are implicit in the structure, and it will find only a fixed number of them.[10]\nHierarchical clustering\n[edit]Another method for finding community structures in networks is hierarchical clustering. In this method one defines a similarity measure quantifying some (usually topological) type of similarity between node pairs. Commonly used measures include the cosine similarity, the Jaccard index, and the Hamming distance between rows of the adjacency matrix. Then one groups similar nodes into communities according to this measure. There are several common schemes for performing the grouping, the two simplest being single-linkage clustering, in which two groups are considered separate communities if and only if all pairs of nodes in different groups have similarity lower than a given threshold, and complete linkage clustering, in which all nodes within every group have similarity greater than a threshold. An important step is how to determine the threshold to stop the agglomerative clustering, indicating a near-to-optimal community structure. A common strategy consist to build one or several metrics monitoring global properties of the network, which peak at given step of the clustering. An interesting approach in this direction is the use of various similarity or dissimilarity measures, combined through convex sums,.[11] Another approximation is the computation of a quantity monitoring the density of edges within clusters with respect to the density between clusters, such as the partition density, which has been proposed when the similarity metric is defined between edges (which permits the definition of overlapping communities),[12] and extended when the similarity is defined between nodes, which allows to consider alternative definitions of communities such as guilds (i.e. groups of nodes sharing a similar number of links with respect to the same neighbours but not necessarily connected themselves).[13] These methods can be extended to consider multidimensional networks, for instance when we are dealing with networks having nodes with different types of links.[13]\nGirvan–Newman algorithm\n[edit]Another commonly used algorithm for finding communities is the Girvan–Newman algorithm.[1] This algorithm identifies edges in a network that lie between communities and then removes them, leaving behind just the communities themselves. The identification is performed by employing the graph-theoretic measure betweenness centrality, which assigns a number to each edge which is large if the edge lies \"between\" many pairs of nodes.\nThe Girvan–Newman algorithm returns results of reasonable quality and is popular because it has been implemented in a number of standard software packages. But it also runs slowly, taking time O(m2n) on a network of n vertices and m edges, making it impractical for networks of more than a few thousand nodes.[14]\nModularity maximization\n[edit]In spite of its known drawbacks, one of the most widely used methods for community detection is modularity maximization.[14] Modularity is a benefit function that measures the quality of a particular division of a network into communities. The modularity maximization method detects communities by searching over possible divisions of a network for one or more that have particularly high modularity. Since exhaustive search over all possible divisions is usually intractable, practical algorithms are based on approximate optimization methods such as greedy algorithms, simulated annealing, or spectral optimization, with different approaches offering different balances between speed and accuracy.[15][16] A popular modularity maximization approach is the Louvain method, which iteratively optimizes local communities until global modularity can no longer be improved given perturbations to the current community state.[17][18]\nThe usefulness of modularity optimization is questionable, as it has been shown that modularity optimization often fails to detect clusters smaller than some scale, depending on the size of the network (resolution limit[19]); on the other hand the landscape of modularity values is characterized by a huge degeneracy of partitions with high modularity, close to the absolute maximum, which may be very different from each other.[20]\nStatistical inference\n[edit]Methods based on statistical inference attempt to fit a generative model to the network data, which encodes the community structure. The overall advantage of this approach compared to the alternatives is its more principled nature, and the capacity to inherently address issues of statistical significance. Most methods in the literature are based on the stochastic block model[21] as well as variants including mixed membership,[22][23] degree-correction,[24] and hierarchical structures.[25] Model selection can be performed using principled approaches such as minimum description length[26][27] (or equivalently, Bayesian model selection[28]) and likelihood-ratio test.[29] Currently many algorithms exist to perform efficient inference of stochastic block models, including belief propagation[30][31] and agglomerative Monte Carlo.[32]\nIn contrast to approaches that attempt to cluster a network given an objective function, this class of methods is based on generative models, which not only serve as a description of the large-scale structure of the network, but also can be used to generalize the data and predict the occurrence of missing or spurious links in the network.[33][34]\nClique-based methods\n[edit]Cliques are subgraphs in which every node is connected to every other node in the clique. As nodes can not be more tightly connected than this, it is not surprising that there are many approaches to community detection in networks based on the detection of cliques in a graph and the analysis of how these overlap. Note that as a node can be a member of more than one clique, a node can be a member of more than one community in these methods giving an \"overlapping community structure\".\nOne approach is to find the \"maximal cliques\". That is to find the cliques which are not the subgraph of any other clique. The classic algorithm to find these is the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm. The overlap of these can be used to define communities in several ways. The simplest is to consider only maximal cliques bigger than a minimum size (number of nodes). The union of these cliques then defines a subgraph whose components (disconnected parts) then define communities.[35] Such approaches are often implemented in social network analysis software such as UCInet.\nThe alternative approach is to use cliques of fixed size . The overlap of these can be used to define a type of -regular hypergraph or a structure which is a generalisation of the line graph (the case when ) known as a \"Clique graph\".[36] The clique graphs have vertices which represent the cliques in the original graph while the edges of the clique graph record the overlap of the clique in the original graph. Applying any of the previous community detection methods (which assign each node to a community) to the clique graph then assigns each clique to a community. This can then be used to determine community membership of nodes in the cliques. Again as a node may be in several cliques, it can be a member of several communities. For instance the clique percolation method[37] defines communities as percolation clusters of -cliques. To do this it finds all -cliques in a network, that is all the complete sub-graphs of -nodes. It then defines two -cliques to be adjacent if they share nodes, that is this is used to define edges in a clique graph. A community is then defined to be the maximal union of -cliques in which we can reach any -clique from any other -clique through series of -clique adjacencies. That is communities are just the connected components in the clique graph. Since a node can belong to several different -clique percolation clusters at the same time, the communities can overlap with each other.\nCommunity detection in latent feature spaces\n[edit]A network can be represented or projected onto a latent space via representation learning methods to efficiently represent a system. Then, various clustering methods can be employed to detect community structures. For Euclidean spaces, methods like embedding-based Silhouette community detection[38] can be utilized. For Hypergeometric latent spaces, critical gap method or modified density-based, hierarchical, or partitioning-based clustering methods can be utilized.[39]\nTesting methods of finding communities algorithms\n[edit]The evaluation of algorithms, to detect which are better at detecting community structure, is still an open question. It must be based on analyses of networks of known structure. A typical example is the \"four groups\" test, in which a network is divided into four equally-sized groups (usually of 32 nodes each) and the probabilities of connection within and between groups varied to create more or less challenging structures for the detection algorithm. Such benchmark graphs are a special case of the planted l-partition model[40] of Condon and Karp, or more generally of \"stochastic block models\", a general class of random network models containing community structure. Other more flexible benchmarks have been proposed that allow for varying group sizes and nontrivial degree distributions, such as LFR benchmark[41] [42] which is an extension of the four groups benchmark that includes heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size, making it a more severe test of community detection methods.[43][44]\nCommonly used computer-generated benchmarks start with a network of well-defined communities. Then, this structure is degraded by rewiring or removing links and it gets harder and harder for the algorithms to detect the original partition. At the end, the network reaches a point where it is essentially random. This kind of benchmark may be called \"open\". The performance on these benchmarks is evaluated by measures such as normalized mutual information or variation of information. They compare the solution obtained by an algorithm [42] with the original community structure, evaluating the similarity of both partitions.\nDetectability\n[edit]During recent years, a rather surprising result has been obtained by various groups which shows that a phase transition exists in the community detection problem, showing that as the density of connections inside communities and between communities become more and more equal or both become smaller (equivalently, as the community structure becomes too weak or the network becomes too sparse), suddenly the communities become undetectable. In a sense, the communities themselves still exist, since the presence and absence of edges is still correlated with the community memberships of their endpoints; but it becomes information-theoretically impossible to label the nodes better than chance, or even distinguish the graph from one generated by a null model such as the Erdos–Renyi model without community structure. This transition is independent of the type of algorithm being used to detect communities, implying that there exists a fundamental limit on our ability to detect communities in networks, even with optimal Bayesian inference (i.e., regardless of our computational resources).[45][46][47]\nConsider a stochastic block model with total nodes, groups of equal size, and let and be the connection probabilities inside and between the groups respectively. If , the network would possess community structure since the link density inside the groups would be more than the density of links between the groups. In the sparse case, and scale as so that the average degree is constant:\n- and\nThen it becomes impossible to detect the communities when:[46]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b c M.

This is a geometric type of phase transition, since at a critical fraction of addition the network of small, disconnected clusters merge into significantly larger connected, so-called spanning clusters. The applications of percolation theory to materials science and in many other disciplines are discussed here and in the articles Network theory and Percolation (cognitive psychology).\nIntroduction\n[edit]A representative question (and the source of the name) is as follows. Assume that some liquid is poured on top of some porous material. Will the liquid be able to make its way from hole to hole and reach the bottom? This physical question is modelled mathematically as a three-dimensional network of n × n × n vertices, usually called \"sites\", in which the edge or \"bonds\" between each two neighbors may be open (allowing the liquid through) with probability p, or closed with probability 1 – p, and they are assumed to be independent. Therefore, for a given p, what is the probability that an open path (meaning a path, each of whose links is an \"open\" bond) exists from the top to the bottom? The behavior for large n is of primary interest. This problem, called now bond percolation, was introduced in the mathematics literature by Broadbent & Hammersley (1957),[1] and has been studied intensively by mathematicians and physicists since then.\nIn a slightly different mathematical model for obtaining a random graph, a site is \"occupied\" with probability p or \"empty\" (in which case its edges are removed) with probability 1 – p; the corresponding problem is called site percolation. The question is the same: for a given p, what is the probability that a path exists between top and bottom? Similarly, one can ask, given a connected graph at what fraction 1 – p of failures the graph will become disconnected (no large component).\nThe same questions can be asked for any lattice dimension. As is quite typical, it is actually easier to examine infinite networks than just large ones. In this case the corresponding question is: does an infinite open cluster exist? That is, is there a path of connected points of infinite length \"through\" the network? By Kolmogorov's zero–one law, for any given p, the probability that an infinite cluster exists is either zero or one. Since this probability is an increasing function of p (proof via coupling argument), there must be a critical p (denoted by pc) below which the probability is always 0 and above which the probability is always 1. In practice, this criticality is very easy to observe. Even for n as small as 100, the probability of an open path from the top to the bottom increases sharply from very close to zero to very close to one in a short span of values of p.\nHistory\n[edit]The Flory–Stockmayer theory (1941), which studied the transition to gelation in polymerization reactions, was the first theory investigating percolation processes.[2]\nThe history of the percolation model as we know it has its root in the coal industry. Since the industrial revolution, the economical importance of this source of energy fostered many scientific studies to understand its composition and optimize its use. During the 1930s and 1940s, the qualitative analysis by organic chemistry left more and more room to more quantitative studies. [3]\nIn this context, the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) was created in 1938. It was a research association funded by the coal mines owners. In 1942, Rosalind Franklin, who then recently graduated in chemistry from the university of Cambridge, joined the BCURA. She started research on the density and porosity of coal. During the Second World War, coal was an important strategic resource. It was used as a source of energy, but also was the main constituent of gas masks.\nCoal is a porous medium. To measure its 'real' density, one was to sink it in a liquid or a gas whose molecules are small enough to fill its microscopic pores. While trying to measure the density of coal using several gases (helium, methanol, hexane, benzene), and as she found different values depending on the gas used, Rosalind Franklin showed that the pores of coal are made of microstructures of various lengths that act as a microscopic sieve to discriminate the gases. She also discovered that the size of these structures depends on the temperature of carbonation during the coal production. With this research, she obtained a PhD degree and left the BCURA in 1946. [4]\nIn the mid fifties, Simon Broadbent worked in the BCURA as a statistician. Among other interests, he studied the use of coal in gas masks. One question is to understand how a fluid can diffuse in the coal pores, modeled as a random maze of open or closed tunnels. In 1954, during a symposium on Monte Carlo methods, he asks questions to John Hammersley on the use of numerical methods to analyze this model. [5]\nBroadbent and Hammersley introduced in their article of 1957 a mathematical model to model this phenomenon, that is percolation.\nComputation of the critical parameter\n[edit]For most infinite lattice graphs, pc cannot be calculated exactly, though in some cases there is an exact value. For example:\n- for the square lattice ℤ2 in two dimensions, pc = 1/2 for bond percolation, a fact which was an open question for more than 20 years and was finally resolved by Harry Kesten in the early 1980s,[6] see Kesten (1982). For site percolation on the square lattice, the value of pc is not known from analytic derivation but only via simulations of large lattices which provide the estimate pc = 0.59274621 ± 0.00000013.[7]\n- A limit case for lattices in high dimensions is given by the Bethe lattice, whose threshold is at pc = 1/z − 1 for a coordination number z. In other words: for the regular tree of degree , is equal to .\n- For a random tree-like network without degree-degree correlation, it can be shown that such network can have a giant component, and the percolation threshold (transmission probability) is given by , where is the generating function corresponding to the excess degree distribution. So, for random Erdős–Rényi networks of average degree , pc = 1/⟨k⟩.[8][9][10]\n- In networks with low clustering, , the critical point gets scaled by such that:\nThis indicates that for a given degree distribution, the clustering leads to a larger percolation threshold, mainly because for a fixed number of links, the clustering structure reinforces the core of the network with the price of diluting the global connections. For networks with high clustering, strong clustering could induce the core–periphery structure, in which the core and periphery might percolate at different critical points, and the above approximate treatment is not applicable.[12]\nPhases\n[edit]Subcritical and supercritical\n[edit]The main fact in the subcritical phase is \"exponential decay\". That is, when p < pc, the probability that a specific point (for example, the origin) is contained in an open cluster (meaning a maximal connected set of \"open\" edges of the graph) of size r decays to zero exponentially in r. This was proved for percolation in three and more dimensions by Menshikov (1986) and independently by Aizenman & Barsky (1987). In two dimensions, it formed part of Kesten's proof that pc = 1/2.[13]\nThe dual graph of the square lattice ℤ2 is also the square lattice. It follows that, in two dimensions, the supercritical phase is dual to a subcritical percolation process. This provides essentially full information about the supercritical model with d = 2. The main result for the supercritical phase in three and more dimensions is that, for sufficiently large N, there is almost certainly an infinite open cluster in the two-dimensional slab ℤ2 × [0, N]d − 2. This was proved by Grimmett & Marstrand (1990).[14]\nIn two dimensions with p < 1/2, there is with probability one a unique infinite closed cluster (a closed cluster is a maximal connected set of \"closed\" edges of the graph). Thus the subcritical phase may be described as finite open islands in an infinite closed ocean. When p > 1/2 just the opposite occurs, with finite closed islands in an infinite open ocean. The picture is more complicated when d ≥ 3 since pc < 1/2, and there is coexistence of infinite open and closed clusters for p between pc and 1 − pc.\nCriticality\n[edit]Percolation has a singularity at the critical point p = pc and many properties behave as of a power-law with , near . Scaling theory predicts the existence of critical exponents, depending on the number d of dimensions, that determine the class of the singularity. When d = 2 these predictions are backed up by arguments from conformal field theory and Schramm–Loewner evolution, and include predicted numerical values for the exponents. Most of these predictions are conjectural except when the number d of dimensions satisfies either d = 2 or d ≥ 6. They include:\n- There are no infinite clusters (open or closed)\n- The probability that there is an open path from some fixed point (say the origin) to a distance of r decreases polynomially, i.e. is on the order of rα for some α\n- α does not depend on the particular lattice chosen, or on other local parameters. It depends only on the dimension d (this is an instance of the universality principle).\n- αd decreases from d = 2 until d = 6 and then stays fixed.\n- α2 = −5/48\n- α6 = −1.\n- The shape of a large cluster in two dimensions is conformally invariant.\nSee Grimmett (1999).[15] In 11 or more dimensions, these facts are largely proved using a technique known as the lace expansion. It is believed that a version of the lace expansion should be valid for 7 or more dimensions, perhaps with implications also for the threshold case of 6 dimensions. The connection of percolation to the lace expansion is found in Hara & Slade (1990).[16]\nIn two dimensions, the first fact (\"no percolation in the critical phase\") is proved for many lattices, using duality. Substantial progress has been made on two-dimensional percolation through the conjecture of Oded Schramm that the scaling limit of a large cluster may be described in terms of a Schramm–Loewner evolution. This conjecture was proved by Smirnov (2001)[17] in the special case of site percolation on the triangular lattice.\nDifferent models\n[edit]- Directed percolation that models the effect of gravitational forces acting on the liquid was also introduced in Broadbent & Hammersley (1957),[1] and has connections with the contact process.\n- The first model studied was Bernoulli percolation. In this model all bonds are independent. This model is called bond percolation by physicists.\n- A generalization was next introduced as the Fortuin–Kasteleyn random cluster model, which has many connections with the Ising model and other Potts models.\n- Bernoulli (bond) percolation on complete graphs is an example of a random graph. The critical probability is p = 1/N, where N is the number of vertices (sites) of the graph.\n- Bootstrap percolation removes active cells from clusters when they have too few active neighbors, and looks at the connectivity of the remaining cells.[18]\n- First passage percolation.\n- Invasion percolation.\nApplications\n[edit]In biology, biochemistry, and physical virology\n[edit]Percolation theory has been used to successfully predict the fragmentation of biological virus shells (capsids),[19][20] with the fragmentation threshold of Hepatitis B virus capsid predicted and detected experimentally.[21] When a critical number of subunits has been randomly removed from the nanoscopic shell, it fragments and this fragmentation may be detected using Charge Detection Mass Spectroscopy (CDMS) among other single-particle techniques. This is a molecular analog to the common board game Jenga, and has relevance to the broader study of virus disassembly. More stable viral particles (tilings with greater fragmentation thresholds) are found in greater abundance in nature.[19]\nIn ecology\n[edit]Percolation theory has been applied to studies of how environment fragmentation impacts animal habitats[22] and models of how the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis spreads.[23]\nSee also\n[edit]- Bunkbed conjecture – Conjecture in probabilistic combinatorics\n- Continuum percolation theory – Branch of mathematics in probability theory\n- Critical exponent – Parameter describing physics near critical points\n- Directed percolation – Physical models of filtering under forces such as gravity\n- Erdős–Rényi model – Two closely related models for generating random graphs\n- Fractal – Infinitely detailed mathematical structure\n- Giant component – Large connected component of a random graph\n- Graph theory – Area of discrete mathematics\n- Interdependent networks – Subfield of network science\n- Invasion percolation\n- Kahn–Kalai conjecture – Mathematical proposition\n- Network theory – Study of graphs as a representation of relations between discrete objects\n- Network science – Academic field\n- Percolation threshold – Threshold of percolation theory models\n- Percolation critical exponents – Mathematical parameter in percolation theory\n- Scale-free network – Network whose degree distribution follows a power law\n- Shortest path problem – Computational problem of graph theory\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b Broadbent, Simon; Hammersley, John (1957). \"Percolation processes I.

They are a natural extension of network science since almost all real world networks evolve over time, either by adding or removing nodes or links over time. Often all of these processes occur simultaneously, such as in social networks where people make and lose friends over time, thereby creating and destroying edges, and some people become part of new social networks or leave their networks, changing the nodes in the network. Evolving network concepts build on established network theory and are now being introduced into studying networks in many diverse fields.\nNetwork theory background\n[edit]The study of networks traces its foundations to the development of graph theory, which was first analyzed by Leonhard Euler in 1736 when he wrote the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg paper. Probabilistic network theory then developed with the help of eight famous papers studying random graphs written by Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi. The Erdős–Rényi model (ER) supposes that a graph is composed of N labeled nodes where each pair of nodes is connected by a preset probability p.\nWhile the ER model's simplicity has helped it find many applications, it does not accurately describe many real world networks. The ER model fails to generate local clustering and triadic closures as often as they are found in real world networks. Therefore, the Watts and Strogatz model was proposed, whereby a network is constructed as a regular ring lattice, and then nodes are rewired according to some probability β.[1] This produces a locally clustered network and dramatically reduces the average path length, creating networks which represent the small world phenomenon observed in many real world networks.[2]\nDespite this achievement, both the ER and the Watts and Storgatz models fail to account for the formulation of hubs as observed in many real world networks. The degree distribution in the ER model follows a Poisson distribution, while the Watts and Strogatz model produces graphs that are homogeneous in degree. Many networks are instead scale free, meaning that their degree distribution follows a power law of the form:\nThis exponent turns out to be approximately 3 for many real world networks, however, it is not a universal constant and depends continuously on the network's parameters [3]\nFirst evolving network model – scale-free networks\n[edit]The Barabási–Albert (BA) model was the first widely accepted model to produce scale-free networks. This was accomplished by incorporating preferential attachment and growth, where nodes are added to the network over time and are more likely to link to other nodes with high degree distributions. The BA model was first applied to degree distributions on the web, where both of these effects can be clearly seen. New web pages are added over time, and each new page is more likely to link to highly visible hubs like Google which have high degree distributions than to nodes with only a few links. Formally this preferential attachment is:\nAdditions to BA model\n[edit]The BA model was the first model to derive the network topology from the way the network was constructed with nodes and links being added over time. However, the model makes only the simplest assumptions necessary for a scale-free network to emerge, namely that there is linear growth and linear preferential attachment. This minimal model does not capture variations in the shape of the degree distribution, variations in the degree exponent, or the size independent clustering coefficient. Therefore, the original model has since been modified[by whom?] to more fully capture the properties of evolving networks by introducing a few new properties.\nFitness\n[edit]One concern with the BA model is that the degree distributions of each nodes experience strong positive feedback whereby the earliest nodes with high degree distributions continue to dominate the network indefinitely. However, this can be alleviated by introducing a fitness for each node, which modifies the probability of new links being created with that node or even of links to that node being removed.[4]\nIn order to preserve the preferential attachment from the BA model, this fitness is then multiplied by the preferential attachment based on degree distribution to give the true probability that a link is created which connects to node i.\nWhere is the fitness, which may also depend on time. A decay of fitness with respect to time may occur and can be formalized by\nwhere increases with\nRemoving nodes and rewiring links\n[edit]Further complications arise because nodes may be removed from the network with some probability. Additionally, existing links may be destroyed and new links between existing nodes may be created. The probability of these actions occurring may depend on time and may also be related to the node's fitness. Probabilities can be assigned to these events by studying the characteristics of the network in question in order to grow a model network with identical properties. This growth would take place with one of the following actions occurring at each time step:\nProb p: add an internal link.\nProb q: delete a link.\nProb r: delete a node.\nProb 1-p-q-r: add a node.\nOther ways of characterizing evolving networks\n[edit]In addition to growing network models as described above, there may be times when other methods are more useful or convenient for characterizing certain properties of evolving networks.\nConvergence towards equilibria\n[edit]In networked systems where competitive decision making takes place, game theory is often used to model system dynamics, and convergence towards equilibria can be considered as a driver of topological evolution. For example, Kasthurirathna and Piraveenan [5] have shown that when individuals in a system display varying levels of rationality, improving the overall system rationality might be an evolutionary reason for the emergence of scale-free networks. They demonstrated this by applying evolutionary pressure on an initially random network which simulates a range of classic games, so that the network converges towards Nash equilibria while being allowed to re-wire. The networks become increasingly scale-free during this process.\nTreat evolving networks as successive snapshots of a static network\n[edit]The most common way to view evolving networks is by considering them as successive static networks. This could be conceptualized as the individual still images which compose a motion picture. Many simple parameters exist to describe a static network (number of nodes, edges, path length, connected components), or to describe specific nodes in the graph such as the number of links or the clustering coefficient. These properties can then individually be studied as a time series using signal processing notions.[6] For example, we can track the number of links established to a server per minute by looking at the successive snapshots of the network and counting these links in each snapshot.\nUnfortunately, the analogy of snapshots to a motion picture also reveals the main difficulty with this approach: the time steps employed are very rarely suggested by the network and are instead arbitrary. Using extremely small time steps between each snapshot preserves resolution, but may actually obscure wider trends which only become visible over longer timescales. Conversely, using larger timescales loses the temporal order of events within each snapshot. Therefore, it may be difficult to find the appropriate timescale for dividing the evolution of a network into static snapshots.\nDefine dynamic properties\n[edit]It may be important to look at properties which cannot be directly observed by treating evolving networks as a sequence of snapshots, such as the duration of contacts between nodes[7] Other similar properties can be defined and then it is possible to instead track these properties through the evolution of a network and visualize them directly.\nAnother issue with using successive snapshots is that only slight changes in network topology can have large effects on the outcome of algorithms designed to find communities. Therefore, it is necessary to use a non classical definition of communities which permits following the evolution of the community through a set of rules such as birth, death, merge, split, growth, and contraction.[8][9]\nApplications\n[edit]Almost all real world networks are evolving networks since they are constructed over time. By varying the respective probabilities described above, it is possible to use the expanded BA model to construct a network with nearly identical properties as many observed networks.[10] Moreover, the concept of scale free networks shows us that time evolution is a necessary part of understanding the network's properties, and that it is difficult to model an existing network as having been created instantaneously. Real evolving networks which are currently being studied include social networks, communications networks, the internet, the movie actor network, the World Wide Web, and transportation networks.\nFurther reading\n[edit]- \"Understanding Network Science,\" https://web.archive.org/web/20110718151116/http://www.zangani.com/blog/2007-1030-networkingscience\n- \"Linked: The New Science of Networks\", A.-L.

Controllability describes our ability to guide a dynamical system from any initial state to any desired final state in finite time, with a suitable choice of inputs. This definition agrees well with our intuitive notion of control. The controllability of general directed and weighted complex networks has recently been the subject of intense study by a number of groups in wide variety of networks, worldwide. Recent studies by Sharma et al.[1] on multi-type biological networks (gene–gene, miRNA–gene, and protein–protein interaction networks) identified control targets in phenotypically characterized Osteosarcoma showing important role of genes and proteins responsible for maintaining tumor microenvironment.\nBackground\n[edit]Consider the canonical linear time-invariant dynamics on a complex network where the vector captures the state of a system of nodes at time . The matrix describes the system's wiring diagram and the interaction strength between the components. The matrix identifies the nodes controlled by an outside controller. The system is controlled through the time dependent input vector that the controller imposes on the system. To identify the minimum number of driver nodes, denoted by , whose control is sufficient to fully control the system's dynamics, Liu et al.[2] attempted to combine the tools from structural control theory, graph theory and statistical physics. They showed[2] that the minimum number of inputs or driver nodes needed to maintain full control of the network is determined by the maximum-cardinality matching in the network. From this result, an analytical framework, based on the in–out degree distribution, was developed to predict for scale-free and Erdős–Rényi random graphs.[2] However, more recently it has been demonstrated that network controllability (and other structure-only methods that use exclusively the connectivity of a graph, , to simplify the underlying dynamics), both undershoot and overshoot the number and which sets of driver nodes best control network dynamics, highlighting the importance of redundancy (e.g. canalization) and non-linear dynamics in determining control.[3]\nIt is also notable that Liu's et al. formulation[2] would predict same values of for a chain graph and for a weak densely connected graph. Obviously, both these graphs have very different in and out degree distributions. A recent unpublished work[4] questions whether degree, which is a purely local measure in networks, would completely describe controllability and whether even slightly distant nodes would have no role in deciding network controllability. Indeed, for many real-word networks, namely, food webs, neuronal and metabolic networks, the mismatch in values of and calculated by Liu et al.[2] is notable. If controllability is decided mainly by degree, why are and so different for many real world networks? They argued[2] (arXiv:1203.5161v1) that this might be due to the effect of degree correlations. However, it has been shown[4] that network controllability can be altered only by using betweenness centrality and closeness centrality, without using degree (graph theory) or degree correlations at all.\nStructural controllability\n[edit]The concept of the structural properties was first introduced by Lin (1974)[5] and then extended by Shields and Pearson (1976)[6] and alternatively derived by Glover and Silverman (1976).[7] The main question is whether the lack of controllability or observability are generic with respect to the variable system parameters. In the framework of structural control the system parameters are either independent free variables or fixed zeros. This is consistent for models of physical systems since parameter values are never known exactly, with the exception of zero values which express the absence of interactions or connections.\nMaximum matching\n[edit]In graph theory, a matching is a set of edges without common vertices. Liu et al.[2] extended this definition to directed graph, where a matching is a set of directed edges that do not share start or end vertices. It is easy to check that a matching of a directed graph composes of a set of vertex-disjoint simple paths and cycles. The maximum matching of a directed network can be efficiently calculated by working in the bipartite representation using the classical Hopcroft–Karp algorithm, which runs in O(E√N) time in the worst case. For undirected graph, analytical solutions of the size and number of maximum matchings have been studied using the cavity method developed in statistical physics.[8] Liu et al.[2] extended the calculations for directed graph.\nBy calculating the maximum matchings of a wide range of real networks, Liu et al.[2] asserted that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the networks degree distribution . They also calculated the average number of driver nodes for a network ensemble with arbitrary degree distribution using the cavity method. It is interesting that for a chain graph and a weak densely connected graph, both of which have very different in and out degree distributions; the formulation of Liu et al.[2] would predict same values of . Also, for many real-word networks, namely, food webs, neuronal and metabolic networks, the mismatch in values of and calculated by Liu et al.[2] is notable. If controllability is decided purely by degree, why are and so different for many real world networks? It remains open to scrutiny whether \"control robustness\" in networks is influenced more by using betweenness centrality and closeness centrality[4] over degree-based metrics.\nWhile sparser graphs are more difficult to control,[2][4] it would obviously be interesting to find whether betweenness centrality and closeness centrality[4] or degree heterogeneity[2] plays a more important role in deciding controllability of sparse graphs with almost-similar degree distributions.\nControl of composite quantum systems and algebraic graph theory\n[edit]A control theory of networks has also been developed in the context of universal control for composite quantum systems, where subsystems and their interactions are associated to nodes and links, respectively.[9] This framework permits formulation of Kalman's criterion with tools from algebraic graph theory via the minimum rank of a graph and related notions.[10][11]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Sharma, Ankush; Cinti, Caterina; Capobianco, Enrico (2017). \"Multitype Network-Guided Target Controllability in Phenotypically Characterized Osteosarcoma: Role of Tumor Microenvironment\".

This drawing should not be confused with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph.[2] In the abstract, all that matters is which pairs of vertices are connected by edges. In the concrete, however, the arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its understandability, usability, fabrication cost, and aesthetics.[3] The problem gets worse if the graph changes over time by adding and deleting edges (dynamic graph drawing) and the goal is to preserve the user's mental map.[4]\nGraphical conventions\n[edit]Graphs are frequently drawn as node–link diagrams in which the vertices are represented as disks, boxes, or textual labels and the edges are represented as line segments, polylines, or curves in the Euclidean plane.[3] Node–link diagrams can be traced back to the 14th-16th century works of Pseudo-Lull which were published under the name of Ramon Llull, a 13th century polymath. Pseudo-Lull drew diagrams of this type for complete graphs in order to analyze all pairwise combinations among sets of metaphysical concepts.[5]\nIn the case of directed graphs, arrowheads form a commonly used graphical convention to show their orientation;[2] however, user studies have shown that other conventions such as tapering provide this information more effectively.[6] Upward planar drawing uses the convention that every edge is oriented from a lower vertex to a higher vertex, making arrowheads unnecessary.[7]\nAlternative conventions to node–link diagrams include adjacency representations such as circle packings, in which vertices are represented by disjoint regions in the plane and edges are represented by adjacencies between regions; intersection representations in which vertices are represented by non-disjoint geometric objects and edges are represented by their intersections; visibility representations in which vertices are represented by regions in the plane and edges are represented by regions that have an unobstructed line of sight to each other; confluent drawings, in which edges are represented as smooth curves within mathematical train tracks; fabrics, in which nodes are represented as horizontal lines and edges as vertical lines;[8] and visualizations of the adjacency matrix of the graph.\nQuality measures\n[edit]Many different quality measures have been defined for graph drawings, in an attempt to find objective means of evaluating their aesthetics and usability.[9] In addition to guiding the choice between different layout methods for the same graph, some layout methods attempt to directly optimize these measures.\n- The crossing number of a drawing is the number of pairs of edges that cross each other. If the graph is planar, then it is often convenient to draw it without any edge intersections; that is, in this case, a graph drawing represents a graph embedding. However, nonplanar graphs frequently arise in applications, so graph drawing algorithms must generally allow for edge crossings.[10]\n- The area of a drawing is the size of its smallest bounding box, relative to the closest distance between any two vertices. Drawings with smaller area are generally preferable to those with larger area, because they allow the features of the drawing to be shown at greater size and therefore more legibly. The aspect ratio of the bounding box may also be important.\n- Symmetry display is the problem of finding symmetry groups within a given graph, and finding a drawing that displays as much of the symmetry as possible. Some layout methods automatically lead to symmetric drawings; alternatively, some drawing methods start by finding symmetries in the input graph and using them to construct a drawing.[11]\n- It is important that edges have shapes that are as simple as possible, to make it easier for the eye to follow them. In polyline drawings, the complexity of an edge may be measured by its number of bends, and many methods aim to provide drawings with few total bends or few bends per edge. Similarly for spline curves the complexity of an edge may be measured by the number of control points on the edge.\n- Several commonly used quality measures concern lengths of edges: it is generally desirable to minimize the total length of the edges as well as the maximum length of any edge. Additionally, it may be preferable for the lengths of edges to be uniform rather than highly varied.\n- Angular resolution is a measure of the sharpest angles in a graph drawing. If a graph has vertices with high degree then it necessarily will have small angular resolution, but the angular resolution can be bounded below by a function of the degree.[12]\n- The slope number of a graph is the minimum number of distinct edge slopes needed in a drawing with straight line segment edges (allowing crossings). Cubic graphs have slope number at most four, but graphs of degree five may have unbounded slope number; it remains open whether the slope number of degree-4 graphs is bounded.[12]\nLayout methods\n[edit]There are many different graph layout strategies:\n- In force-based layout systems, the graph drawing software modifies an initial vertex placement by continuously moving the vertices according to a system of forces based on physical metaphors related to systems of springs or molecular mechanics. Typically, these systems combine attractive forces between adjacent vertices with repulsive forces between all pairs of vertices, in order to seek a layout in which edge lengths are small while vertices are well-separated. These systems may perform gradient descent based minimization of an energy function, or they may translate the forces directly into velocities or accelerations for the moving vertices.[14]\n- Spectral layout methods use as coordinates the eigenvectors of a matrix such as the Laplacian derived from the adjacency matrix of the graph.[15]\n- Orthogonal layout methods, which allow the edges of the graph to run horizontally or vertically, parallel to the coordinate axes of the layout. These methods were originally designed for VLSI and PCB layout problems but they have also been adapted for graph drawing. They typically involve a multiphase approach in which an input graph is planarized by replacing crossing points by vertices, a topological embedding of the planarized graph is found, edge orientations are chosen to minimize bends, vertices are placed consistently with these orientations, and finally a layout compaction stage reduces the area of the drawing.[16]\n- Tree layout algorithms these show a rooted tree-like formation, suitable for trees. Often, in a technique called \"balloon layout\", the children of each node in the tree are drawn on a circle surrounding the node, with the radii of these circles diminishing at lower levels in the tree so that these circles do not overlap.[17]\n- Layered graph drawing methods (often called Sugiyama-style drawing) are best suited for directed acyclic graphs or graphs that are nearly acyclic, such as the graphs of dependencies between modules or functions in a software system. In these methods, the nodes of the graph are arranged into horizontal layers using methods such as the Coffman–Graham algorithm, in such a way that most edges go downwards from one layer to the next; after this step, the nodes within each layer are arranged in order to minimize crossings.[18]\n- Arc diagrams, a layout style dating back to the 1960s,[19] place vertices on a line; edges may be drawn as semicircles above or below the line, or as smooth curves linked together from multiple semicircles.\n- Circular layout methods place the vertices of the graph on a circle, choosing carefully the ordering of the vertices around the circle to reduce crossings and place adjacent vertices close to each other. Edges may be drawn either as chords of the circle or as arcs inside or outside of the circle. In some cases, multiple circles may be used.[20]\n- Dominance drawing places vertices in such a way that one vertex is upwards, rightwards, or both of another if and only if it is reachable from the other vertex. In this way, the layout style makes the reachability relation of the graph visually apparent.[21]\nApplication-specific graph drawings\n[edit]Graphs and graph drawings arising in other areas of application include\n- Sociograms, drawings of a social network, as often offered by social network analysis software[22]\n- Hasse diagrams, a type of graph drawing specialized to partial orders[23]\n- Dessin d'enfants, a type of graph drawing used in algebraic geometry[24]\n- State diagrams, graphical representations of finite-state machines[25]\n- Computer network diagrams, depictions of the nodes and connections in a computer network[26]\n- Flowcharts and drakon-charts, drawings in which the nodes represent the steps of an algorithm and the edges represent control flow between steps.\n- Project network, graphical depiction of the chronological order in which activities of a project are to be completed.\n- Data-flow diagrams, drawings in which the nodes represent the components of an information system and the edges represent the movement of information from one component to another.\n- Bioinformatics including phylogenetic trees, protein–protein interaction networks, and metabolic pathways.[27]\nIn addition, the placement and routing steps of electronic design automation (EDA) are similar in many ways to graph drawing, as is the problem of greedy embedding in distributed computing, and the graph drawing literature includes several results borrowed from the EDA literature. However, these problems also differ in several important ways: for instance, in EDA, area minimization and signal length are more important than aesthetics, and the routing problem in EDA may have more than two terminals per net while the analogous problem in graph drawing generally only involves pairs of vertices for each edge.\nGraph drawing algorithms\n[edit]There are many algorithms for graph drawing. Among them are:\n- The Reingold-Tilford algorithm for tree drawing.[28]\n- Kant's algorithm,[29] which constructs a polyline drawing of a 3-connected planar graph such that the size of the minimal angle among arcs is at least , where d is the maximal node degree; and its generaliztion, that also works well for other planar graphs, by Gutwenger and Mutzel.[30]\n- Tamassia's algorithm for minimizing the number of bends in an orthogonal representation of a planar graph.[31]\n- The Magnetic Spring Model by Sugiyama and Misue.[32]\nSoftware\n[edit]Software, systems, and providers of systems for drawing graphs include:\n- BioFabric open-source software for visualizing large networks by drawing nodes as horizontal lines.\n- Cytoscape, open-source software for visualizing molecular interaction networks\n- Gephi, open-source network analysis and visualization software\n- graph-tool, a free/libre Python library for analysis of graphs\n- Graphviz, an open-source graph drawing system from AT&T Corporation[33]\n- Linkurious, a commercial network analysis and visualization software for graph databases\n- Mathematica, a general-purpose computation tool that includes 2D and 3D graph visualization and graph analysis tools.[34]\n- Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout, open-source .NET library (formerly called GLEE) for laying out graphs[35]\n- NetworkX is a Python library for studying graphs and networks.\n- Tulip,[36] an open-source data visualization tool\n- yEd, a graph editor with graph layout functionality[37]\n- PGF/TikZ 3.0 with the\ngraphdrawing\npackage (requires LuaTeX).[38] - LaNet-vi, an open-source large network visualization software\n- OGDF, an open-source library of C++ data structures and algorithms, mostly for graph drawing[39]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]Footnotes\n[edit]- ^ Di Battista et al.

Some have described it as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common purpose, although this does not align with how it has been measured.\nSocial capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from strategic alliances, and the evolution of communities.[3]\nHistory\n[edit]While it has been suggested that the term social capital was in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s,[4] the earliest credited use is by Lyda Hanifan in 1916 (see 20th century below).\nThe debate of community versus modernization of society and individualism has been the most discussed topic among the founders of sociology: such theorists as Tönnies (1887),[5] Durkheim (1893),[6] Simmel (1905),[7] Weber (1946)[8] were convinced that industrialisation and urbanization were transforming social relationships in an irreversible way. They observed a breakdown of traditional bonds and the progressive development of anomie and alienation in society.[9]\n18th–19th century\n[edit]The power of community governance has been stressed by many philosophers from antiquity to the 18th century, from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas, and Edmund Burke.[10] This vision was strongly criticised at the end of the 18th century, with the development of the idea of Homo Economicus and subsequently with rational choice theory. Such a set of theories became dominant in the last centuries, but many thinkers questioned the complicated relationship between modern society and the importance of old institutions, in particular family and traditional communities.[9]\nThe concept that underlies social capital has a much longer history; thinkers exploring the relation between associational life and democracy were using similar concepts regularly by the 19th century, drawing on the work of earlier writers such as James Madison (The Federalist Papers) and Alexis de Tocqueville (Democracy in America) to integrate concepts of social cohesion and connectedness into the pluralist tradition in American political science. John Dewey may have made the first direct mainstream use of social capital in The School and Society in 1899, though he did not offer a definition.\nIn the first half of the 19th century, de Tocqueville had observations about American life that seemed to outline and define social capital. He observed that Americans were prone to meeting at as many gatherings as possible to discuss all possible issues of state, economics, or the world that could be witnessed. The high levels of transparency caused greater participation from the people and thus allowed for democracy to work better.\n20th century\n[edit]L. J. Hanifan's 1916 article regarding local support for rural schools is one of the first occurrences of the term social capital in reference to social cohesion and personal investment in the community.[11][12] In defining the concept, Hanifan contrasts social capital with material goods by defining it as:[11]: 130–131\nI do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit.… If he may come into contact with his neighbour, and they with other neighbours, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbours.\nFollowing the works of Tönnies (1887)[5] and Weber (1946),[8] reflection on social links in modern society continued with interesting contributions in the 1950s and in the 1960s. In particular, mass society theory – as developed by Daniel Bell (1962),[13] Robert Nisbet (1969),[14] Maurice R. Stein (1960),[15] William H. Whyte (1956)[16] – proposed themes similar to those of the founders, with a more pessimistic emphasis on the development of society. In the words of Stein (1960:1): \"The price for maintaining a society that encourages cultural differentiation and experimentation is unquestionably the acceptance of a certain amount of disorganization on both the individual and social level.\"\nJane Jacobs used the term early in the 1960s. Although she did not explicitly define the term social capital, her usage referred to the value of networks.[17] Political scientist Robert Salisbury advanced the term as a critical component of interest group formation in his 1969 article \"An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups\" in the Midwest Journal of Political Science.\nSociologist Pierre Bourdieu used the term in 1972 in his Outline of a Theory of Practice,[18] and clarified the term some years later in contrast to cultural, economic, administrative capital, physical capital, political capital, social capital and symbolic capital.[19] Sociologists James Coleman (1988),[20] as well as Barry Wellman & Scot Wortley (1990),[21] adopted Glenn Loury's 1977 definition in developing and popularising the concept.[22] In the late 1990s, the concept gained popularity, serving as the focus of a World Bank research programme [23] and the subject of several mainstream books, including Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone,[24] and Putnam & Lewis Feldstein's Better Together.\nAll of these reflections contributed remarkably to the development of the social capital concept in the following decades. The appearance of the modern social capital conceptualization is a new way to look at this debate, keeping together the importance of community to build generalized trust and the same time, the importance of individual free choice, in order to create a more cohesive society. It is for this reason that social capital generated so much interest in the academic and political world.[25]\nDefinitions and forms\n[edit]Social capital has multiple definitions, interpretations, and uses. David Halpern argues that the popularity of social capital for policymakers is linked to the concept's duality, coming because \"it has a hard nosed economic feel while restating the importance of the social.\" For researchers, the term is popular partly due to the broad range of outcomes it can explain;[26] the multiplicity of uses for social capital has led to a multiplicity of definitions.\nSocial capital has been used at various times to explain superior managerial performance,[27] the growth of entrepreneurial firms,[28] improved performance of functionally diverse groups,[29] the value derived from strategic alliances,[30] and enhanced supply-chain relations.[31] \"A resource that actors derive from specific social structures and then use to pursue their interests; it is created by changes in the relationship among actors\" (Baker 1990, p. 619).\nEarly attempts to define social capital focused on the degree to which social capital serves as a resource – be it for public good or private benefit. Robert D. Putnam (1993) suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast, others focus on the private benefits derived from the web of social relationships in which individual actors find themselves.[32] This is reflected in Nan Lin's concept of social capital as \"Investment in social relations with expected returns in the marketplace.\" This may subsume the concepts of some others such as Bourdieu, Flap and Eriksson.[33] Newton (1997)[34] treats social capital as a subjective phenomenon formed by values and attitudes that influence interactions. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), in their examination of the role of social capital in the creation of intellectual capital, suggest that social capital should be considered in terms of three clusters: structural, relational, and cognitive.[35]\nDefinitional issues\n[edit]A number of scholars have raised concerns about the imprecision in defining social capital. Portes (2000), for example, notes that the term has become so widely used, including in mainstream media, that \"the point is approaching at which social capital comes to be applied to so many events and in so many different contexts as to lose any distinct meaning.\"[36] The term capital is used by analogy with other forms of economic capital, as social capital is argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits. However, the analogy may be misleading in that, unlike financial forms of capital, social capital is not depleted by use;[37] instead, it is depleted by non-use (use it or lose it). In this respect, it is similar to the economic concept of human capital.\nRobison, Schmid, and Siles (2002) review various definitions of social capital and conclude that many do not satisfy the formal requirements of a definition.[38] They assert that definitions must be of the form A=B, while many explanations of social capital describe what it can be used to achieve, where it resides, how it can be created, or what it can transform. In addition, they argue that many proposed definitions of social capital fail to satisfy the requirements of capital. They propose that social capital be defined as sympathy: the object of another's sympathy has social capital; those who have sympathy for others provide social capital.[38] This proposition appears to follow Adam Smith, Theory of Moral Sentiments to some degree, but Smith's conceptualization of sympathy (particularly in the first two chapters of this work) appear more concerned with the roles of acceptance or congruence – in ethics or virtue – in evaluating an individual's 'propriety of action'.\nSocial capital is different from the economic theory of social capitalism, which challenges the idea that socialism and capitalism are mutually exclusive.\nForms of capital (Bourdieu)\n[edit]In The Forms of Capital, Pierre Bourdieu distinguishes between three forms of capital: economic capital, cultural capital and social capital.[39] He defines social capital as \"the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.\"[40] His treatment of the concept is instrumental, focusing on the advantages to possessors of social capital and the \"deliberate construction of sociability for the purpose of creating this resource.\"[41] Quite contrary to Putnam's positive view of social capital, Bourdieu employs the concept to demonstrate a mechanism for the generational reproduction of inequality. Bourdieu thus points out that the wealthy and powerful use their \"old boys network\" or other social capital to maintain advantages for themselves, their social class, and their children.\nNorms of trust and reciprocity (Sander, Putnam, Coleman)\n[edit]Thomas Sander[42] defines it as \"the collective value of all social networks (who people know), and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity).\"[43] Social capital, in this view, emphasizes \"specific benefits that flow from the trust, reciprocity, information, and cooperation associated with social networks.\" It \"creates value for the people who are connected, and for bystanders as well.\"[43] Meanwhile, negative norms of reciprocity serve as disincentives for detrimental and violent behaviors.[44][45]\nJames Coleman defined social capital functionally as \"a variety of entities with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of actors...within the structure\"[20] – that is, social capital is anything that facilitates individual or collective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms.[41] In Coleman's conception, social capital is a neutral resource that facilitates any manner of action, but whether society is better off as a result depends entirely on the individual uses to which it is put.[46]\nAccording to Robert D. Putnam, social capital refers to \"connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them.\"[47] In the view of Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy. Putnam says that social capital is declining in the United States. This is seen in lower levels of trust in government and lower levels of civic participation. Putnam also suggests that a root cause of the decline in social capital is women's entry into the workforce, which could correlate with time restraints that inhibit civic organizational involvement like parent-teacher associations.[48] Technological transformation of leisure (e.g., television) is another cause of declining social capital, as stated by Putnam. This offered a reference point from which several studies assessed social capital measurements by how media is engaged strategically to build social capital.[49]\nCivic association (Fukuyama)\n[edit]In \"Social Capital, Civil Society, and Development\", political economist Francis Fukuyama defines social capital as generally understood rules that enable people to cooperate such as the norm of reciprocity or religious doctrine like Christianity. Social capital is formed by repeated interactions over time and, he argues, is critical for development and difficult to generate through public policy. The importance of social capital for economic development is that these norms of behavior reduce transaction cost of exchange such as legal contracts and government regulations. Fukuyama suggests that while social capital is beneficial for development, it also imposes cost on non-group members with unintended consequences for general welfare.\nReferencing Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America, and what he described as the art of association of the American propensity for civil association, Fukuyama argues social capital is what produces a civil society. While civic engagement is an important part of democracy and development, Fukuyama states that, \"one person's civic engagement is another's rent-seeking.\" Therefore, while social capital can facilitate economic development by reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity, social capital can also distort democracy if civic association enables special interest to gain special favors. However, Fukuyama argues despite the risk of society having too much social capital, it is nonetheless worse to have too little and be unable to organize for public goods and welfare enhancing activity.\nSocial ties\n[edit]Carlos García Timón describes that the structural dimensions of social capital relate to an individual ability to make weak and strong ties to others within a system. This dimension focuses on the advantages derived from the configuration of an actor's, either individual or collective, network.[citation needed] The differences between weak and strong ties are explained by Granovetter (1973).[50] Bridging social capital refers to the weak ties that individuals with heterogeneous limited interactions form. Bridging social capital is more likely to provide valuable new information (Moshkovitz and Hayat, 2021). Some others describes the weak and strong ties relationship as bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital refers to strong ties: the intimate relationships people feel close to and trust. The relational dimension focuses on the character of the connection between individuals. This is best characterized through trust of others and their cooperation and the identification an individual has within a network.[51] Hazleton and Kennan (2000)[52] added a third angle, that of communication. Communication is needed to access and use social capital through exchanging information, identifying problems and solutions, and managing conflict.\nAccording to Boisot (1995),[53] and Boland & Tenkasi (1995),[54] meaningful communication requires at least some sharing context between the parties to such exchange. The cognitive dimension focuses on the shared meaning, representations and interpretations that individuals or groups have with one another.[35]\nNegative social capital\n[edit]Whereas some scholars, most prominently Robert D. Putnam, posit that social capital has positive ends,[55] a sizable body of literature finds that social capital can have adverse effects. Research by Sheri Berman and Dylan Riley, as well as economists Shanker Satyanath, Nico Voigtländer, and Hans-Joachim Voth, have linked civic associations to the rise of fascist movements.[56][57][58] Pierre Bourdieu's work tends to show how social capital can be used practically to produce or reproduce inequality, demonstrating for instance how people gain access to powerful positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections.\nAn example of the complexities of the negative of effects social capital is violence or criminal gang activity that is encouraged through the strengthening of intra-group relationships (bonding social capital).[59] The negative consequences of social capital are more often associated with bonding vis-à-vis bridging.[60]\nWithout \"bridging\" social capital, \"bonding\" groups can become isolated and disenfranchised from the rest of society and, most importantly, from groups with which bridging must occur in order to denote an \"increase\" in social capital. Bonding social capital is a necessary antecedent for the development of the more powerful form of bridging social capital.[61] Bonding and bridging social capital can work together productively if in balance, or they may work against each other. As social capital bonds and stronger homogeneous groups form, the likelihood of bridging social capital is attenuated. Bonding social capital can also perpetuate sentiments of a certain group, allowing for the bonding of certain individuals together upon a common radical ideal. The strengthening of insular ties can lead to a variety of effects such as ethnic marginalization or social isolation. In extreme cases ethnic cleansing may result if the relationship between different groups is so strongly negative. In mild cases, it isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the bonding social capital and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital.\nAccessibility\n[edit]Edwards and Foley, as editors of a special edition of the American Behavioral Scientist on \"Social Capital, Civil Society and Contemporary Democracy\", raised two key issues in the study of social capital. First, social capital is not equally available to all, in much the same way that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic and social isolation limit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society.\nOn top of this, Portes (1998) has identified four negative consequences of social capital:[41]\n- exclusion of outsiders;\n- excess claims on group members;\n- restrictions on individual freedom; and\n- downward levelling norms.\nIn political institutions\n[edit]Social capital (in the institutional Robert Putnam sense) may also lead to bad outcomes if the political institution and democracy in a specific country is not strong enough and is therefore overpowered by the social capital groups. \"Civil society and the collapse of the Weimar Republic\" suggests that \"it was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem during the Wihelmine and Weimar eras.\"[62] Because the political institutions were so weak people looked to other outlets. \"Germans threw themselves into their clubs, voluntary associations, and professional organizations out of frustration with the failures of the national government and political parties, thereby helping to undermine the Weimar Republic and facilitate Hitler's rise to power.\" In this article about the fall of the Weimar Republic, the author makes the claim that Hitler rose to power so quickly because he was able to mobilize the groups towards one common goal. Even though German society was, at the time, a \"joining\" society these groups were fragmented and their members did not use the skills they learned in their club associations to better their society, but to encourage their values across all cultures to provide a better society for people. They were very introverted in the Weimar Republic. Hitler was able to capitalize on this by uniting these highly bonded groups under the common cause of bringing Germany to the top of world politics. The former world order had been destroyed during World War I, and Hitler believed that Germany had the right and the will to become a dominant global power.\nAdditionally, in his essay \"A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital\",[63] Michael Shindler expands upon Berman's argument that Weimar social clubs and similar associations in countries that did not develop democracy, were organized in such a way that they fostered a \"we\" instead of an \"I\" mentality among their members, by arguing that groups which possess cultures that stress solidarity over individuality, even ones that are \"horizontally\" structured and which were also common to pre-Soviet Eastern Europe, will not engender democracy if they are politically aligned with non-democratic ideologies.[64]\nIn race and ethnicity\n[edit]Using a network-based conception for characterizing the social capital of collectivities (such as organizations or business clusters),[65] Lester, Maheshwari, and McLain (2013) note that negative social capital may be the cause for disadvantageous differences among minority firms versus majority firms. While studying norms among African-American family firms and Euro-American family firms, Lester et al. noted that negative social capital was created when the owner of the company was pressured to engage in social behavior not conducive to firm profits.[66]\nRobert Putnam, in his later work, also suggests that social capital, and the associated growth of public trust are inhibited by immigration and rising racial diversity in communities.[67] Putnam's study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a lack of homogeneity, some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (US) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high (Eastern Europe), it was found that citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be. Lack of homogeneity led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital.[68][69]\nVarshney (2001) studied the correlation between the presence of interethnic networks (bridging) versus intra-ethnic ones (bonding) on ethnic violence in India.[70][71] He argues that interethnic networks are agents of peace because they build bridges and manage tensions, by noting that if communities are organized only along intra-ethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak or even nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely. Three main implications of intercommunal ties explain their worth:[70]\n- Facilitate communication in the community across ethnic lines\n- Squelch false rumors\n- Help the administration carry out its job and in particular peace, security and justice\nThis is a useful distinction; nevertheless, its implication on social capital can only be accepted if one espouses the functionalist understanding of the latter concept. Indeed, it can be argued that interethnic, as well as intra-ethnic networks can serve various purposes, either increasing or diminishing social capital. In fact, Varshney himself notes that intra-ethnic policing (equivalent to the \"self-policing\" mechanism proposed by Fearon and Laitin, 1996)[72] may lead to the same result as interethnic engagement.\nSocial inequality\n[edit]James Coleman (1988) has indicated that social capital eventually led to the creation of human capital for the future generation.[20] Human capital, a private resource, could be accessed through what the previous generation accumulated through social capital. John Field (2003) suggested that such a process could lead to the very inequality social capital attempts to resolve.[73] While Coleman viewed social capital as a relatively neutral resource, he did not deny the class reproduction that could result from accessing such capital, given that individuals worked toward their own benefit.\nEven though Coleman never truly addresses Pierre Bourdieu in his discussion, this coincides with Bourdieu's argument set forth in Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture. Bourdieu and Coleman were fundamentally different at the theoretical level (as Bourdieu believed the actions of individuals were rarely ever conscious, but more so only a result of their habitus being enacted within a particular field, but this realization by both seems to undeniably connect their understanding of the more latent aspects of social capital.\nAccording to Bourdieu, habitus refers to the social context within which a social actor is socialized. Thus, it is the social platform, itself, that equips one with the social reality they become accustomed to. Out of habitus comes field, the manner in which one integrates and displays their habitus. To this end, it is the social exchange and interaction between two or more social actors. To illustrate this, we assume that an individual wishes to better his place in society. He therefore accumulates social capital by involving himself in a social network, adhering to the norms of that group, allowing him to later access the resources (e.g. social relationships) gained over time. If, in the case of education, he uses these resources to better his educational outcomes, thereby enabling him to become socially mobile, he effectively has worked to reiterate and reproduce the stratification of society, as social capital has done little to alleviate the system as a whole. This may be one negative aspect of social capital, but seems to be an inevitable one in and of itself, as are all forms of capital.[citation needed]\nPositive consequences of social capital\n[edit]Compared to Bourdieu, Robert D. Putnam has used the concept in a much more positive light: though he was at first careful to argue that social capital was a neutral term, stating \"whether or not [the] shared are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter,\"[46] his work on American society tends to frame social capital as a producer of \"civic engagement\" and also a broad societal measure of communal health.[74] He also transforms social capital from a resource possessed by individuals to an attribute of collectives, focusing on norms and trust as producers of social capital to the exclusion of networks.\nMahyar Arefi (2003) identifies consensus-building as a direct positive indicator of social capital.[75] Consensus implies \"shared interest\" and agreement among various actors and stakeholders to induce collective action. Collective action is thus an indicator of increased social capital.\nSubtypes\n[edit]Bonding, bridging, linking\n[edit]In Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000), Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam writes:[24]\nHenry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America – though it will be – but because it will be good for us.\nPutnam speaks of two main components of the concept, the creation of which Putnam credits to Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal:\n- Bonding social capital: the value assigned to social networks between homogeneous groups of people.\n- Bridging social capital: the value assigned to social networks between socially heterogeneous groups.\nTypical examples are that criminal gangs create bonding social capital, while choirs and bowling clubs (hence the title, as Putnam lamented their decline) create bridging social capital.[76] The distinction is useful in highlighting how social capital may not always be beneficial for society as a whole (though it is always an asset for those individuals and groups involved). Horizontal networks of individual citizens and groups that enhance community productivity and cohesion are said to be positive social capital assets whereas self-serving exclusive gangs and hierarchical patronage systems that operate at cross purposes to societal interests can be thought of as negative social capital burdens on society.\nSimilar to Putnam, Daniel P. Aldrich describes three mechanisms of social capital:\n- Bonding capital: the relationships a person has with friends and family, making it also the strongest form of social capital.\n- Bridging capital: the relationship between friends of friends, making its strength secondary to bonding capital.\n- Linking capital: the relationship between a person and a government official or other elected leader.\nAldrich also applies the ideas of social capital to the fundamental principles of disaster recovery, and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. In his book Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery, he primarily examines Japanese recovery following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown.[77]\nSocial capital development on the internet via social networking websites such as Facebook or Myspace tends to be bridging capital according to one study, though \"virtual\" social capital is a new area of research.[78]\nConsummatory, instrumental\n[edit]There are two other sub-sources of social capital:[79]\n- Consummatory capital: a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent.\n- Examples include value interjection and solidarity.\n- Instrumental capital: behavior that is taught through ones surroundings over time.\nConsummatory capital\n[edit]Consummatory capital a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. Two examples of consummatory social capital are value interjection and solidarity.[79]\nValue interjection: refers to the behavior of individuals or groups adhering to societal norms by meeting expected obligations, such as following established rules, timely bill payments, and punctuality. Diligent adherence contributes personal advantages like financial stability and improved relationships, as well as broader societal gains, including enhanced market confidence and perceived reliability.\nColeman goes on to say that when people live in this way and benefit from this type of social capital, individuals in the society are able to rest assured that their belongings and family will be safe.[80] This understanding of solidarity may be traced to 19th century socialist thinkers, whose main focus was the urban working class of the Industrial Revolution. They analyzed the reasons these workers supported each other for the benefit of the group and held that this support was an adaptation to the immediate social environment, as opposed to a trait that had been taught to the workers in their youth.[79] As another example, Coleman states that possessing this type of social capital individuals to stand up for what they believe in, and even die for it, in the face of adversity.[81]\nWhile the notion of solidarity as social capital is sometimes attributed to Karl Marx, in particular, the term social capital had a quite different meaning for Marx. All forms of \"capital\" were, for Marx, possessed only by capitalists and he emphasized the basis of labour in capitalist society, as a class constituted by individuals obliged to sell their labour power, because they lacked sufficient capital, in any sense of the word, to do otherwise. Marx saw \"social capital\" as a theoretical total amount of capital, purely in the sense of accumulated wealth or property, that existed in a particular society. He thereby contrasted it with specific and discrete \"individual capital.\"[82]\nInstrumental capital\n[edit]Instrumental capital is behavior that is taught through one's surroundings over time. Individuals donating their resources are not seeking direct repayment from the recipient, but motivated by membership in the same social structure. Donors might not see a direct repayment, but, most commonly, they will be held by the society in greater honor.[81]\nPortes mentions the donation of a scholarship to a member of the same ethnic group as an example of this. The donor is not giving up resources to be directly repaid by the recipient, but, as stated above, the honor of the community. With this in mind, recipients might not know the benefactor personally, but prospers as a member of the same social group.[83]\nSocial capital is also linked with religious communities. Religion represents an important aspect of social capital (religious social capital).[84] However, Putnam found that membership in secular organizations in the United States had a greater association with volunteering, blood donations, charity, and philanthropy than membership in religious organizations, that membership in secular organizations was associated with participation in community projects while membership in religious organizations was not, and that the difference was mostly attributable due to community and organizational involvement by religious fundamentalists being confined to activities within their congregations rather than the wider communities in which the congregations are located.[85]\nMeasurement\n[edit]There is no widely held consensus on how to measure social capital, which has become a debate in itself.[86] While usually one can intuitively sense the level/amount of social capital present in a given relationship (regardless of type or scale), quantitative measuring has proven somewhat complicated, resulting in different metrics for different functions.[citation needed]\nSociologists Carl L. Bankston and Min Zhou have argued that one of the reasons social capital is so difficult to measure is that it is neither an individual-level nor a group-level phenomenon, but one that emerges across levels of analysis as individuals participate in groups. They argue that the metaphor of \"capital\" may be misleading because, unlike financial capital, which is a resource held by an individual, the benefits of forms of social organization are not held by actors, but are results of the participation of actors in advantageously organized groups.[87]\nName generators\n[edit]One type of quantitative social capital measure uses name generators to construct social networks and to measure the level of social capital.[88] These networks are constructed by asking participants to name people that they interact with, such as \"Name all the people you've discussed important matters with in the past six months.\"[88] Name generators are often useful to construct core discussion networks of close ties, rather than weaker ties.\nSocial capital scales\n[edit]Many studies measure social capital by asking the question: \"do you trust the others?\" Other researches analyse the participation in voluntary associations or civic activities.\nTo expand upon the methodological potential of measuring online and offline social bonding, as it relates to social capital, Williams (2006), offers a matrix of social capital measures that distinguishes social bridging as a form of less emotionally-tethered relationships compared to bonding. Bonding and bridging sub-scales are proposed, which have been adopted by over 300 scholarly articles.[89]\nLin, Peng, Kim, Kim & LaRose (2012) offer a noteworthy application of the scale by measuring international residents originating from locations outside of the United States. The study found that social media platforms like Facebook provide an opportunity for increased social capital, but mostly for extroverts. However, less introverted social media users could engage social media and build social capital by connecting with Americans before arriving and then maintaining old relationships from home upon arriving to the states. The ultimate outcome of the study indicates that social capital is measurable and is a concept that may be operationalized to understand strategies for coping with cross-cultural immersion through online engagement.\nCohesion measures\n[edit]The level of cohesion of a group also affects its social capital and vice versa.[90][91] However, there is no one quantitative way of determining the level of cohesiveness, but rather a collection of social network models that researchers have used over the decades to operationalize social capital. One of the dominant methods is Ronald Burt's constraint measure, which taps into the role of tie strength and group cohesion. Another network-based model is network transitivity.\nEconomic measures\n[edit]Knack and Keefer (1996) measured econometric correlations between confidence and civic cooperation norms, with economic growth in a large group of countries. They found that confidence and civic cooperation have a great impact in economic growth, and that in less polarized societies in terms of inequality and ethnic differences, social capital is bigger.\nNarayan and Pritchet (1997) researched the associativity degree and economic performance in rural homes of Tanzania. They observed that even in high poverty indexes, families with higher levels of incomes had more participation in collective organizations. The social capital they accumulated because of this participation had individual benefits for them, and created collective benefits through different routes, for example: their agricultural practices were better than those of the families without participation (they had more information about agrochemicals, fertilizers and seeds); they had more information about the market; they were prepared to take more risks, because being part of a social network made them feel more protected; they had an influence on the improvement of public services, showing a bigger level of participation in schools; they cooperated more in the municipality level.\nGroup membership-based\n[edit]In measuring political social capital, it is common to take the sum of society's membership of its groups. Groups with higher membership (such as political parties) contribute more to the amount of capital than groups with lower membership, although many groups with low membership (such as communities) still add up to be significant. While it may seem that this is limited by population, this need not be the case as people join multiple groups. In a study done by Yankee City,[92] a community of 17,000 people was found to have over 22,000 different groups.\nHow a group relates to the rest of society also affects social capital, but in a different manner. Strong internal ties can in some cases weaken the group's perceived capital in the eyes of the general public, as in cases where the group is geared towards crime, distrust, intolerance, violence or hatred towards others. The Ku Klux Klan is an example of this kind of organizations.\nSocial behaviour-based\n[edit]Foschi and Lauriola have presented a measure of sociability as a proxy of social capital. The authors demonstrated that facets of sociability can mediate between general personality traits and measures of civic involvement and political participation, as predictors of social capital, in a holistic model of political behavior.[93]\nThe World Social Capital Monitor is an instrument for measuring social goods and social capital created by the United Nations Sustainable Development Group in partnership with civil society actors. The project identifies social values such as trust, solidarity, helpfulness, friendliness, hospitality and the willingness to finance public goods with the help of anonymous surveys. The surveys started in 2016.[94]\nIntegrating history and socio-economic analysis\n[edit]Beyond Putnam\n[edit]While influential, some have identified areas of concern or improvement within the work of Robert D. Putnam. This includes:\n- the lack of awareness of the structural socio-economic conditions of society.[95][96][97] For example, the level of income inequality.[98][99][100]\n- the excessive determinism of the historical analysis.[101][102][103]\n- Putnam's social capital index does not consider racial diversity which links to worse outcomes.[104] Nor does Putnam consider ethnic diversity, which often creates barriers to cooperation and democratization.[105]\n- the conflation of social capital with civil society, the lack of empirical evidence connecting social capital's promotion of economic growth and substantiating the decline of social capital in the United States in the last 35 years, and the assumption that social networks produce win-win relationships.[86]\nSocial capital motives\n[edit]Robison and colleagues (2012) measured the relative importance of selfishness and four social capital motives using resource allocation data collected in hypothetical surveys and non-hypothetical experiments.[106]\nThe selfishness motive assumes that an agent's allocation of a scarce resource is independent of his relationships with others. This motive is sometimes referred to as the selfishness of preference assumption in neoclassical economics.\nSocial capital motives assume that agents' allocation of a scarce resource may be influenced by their social capital or sympathetic relationships with others which may produce socio-emotional goods that satisfy socio-emotional needs for validation and belonging:[106]\n- The first social capital motive seeks for validation by acting consistently with the values of one's ideal self.\n- The second social capital motive seeks to be validated by others by winning their approval.\n- The third social capital motive seeks to belong. Recognizing that one may not be able to influence the sympathy of others, persons seeking to belong may act to increase their own sympathy for others and the organizations or institutions they represent.\n- The fourth social capital motive recognizes that our sympathy or social capital for another person will motivate us to act in their interest. In doing so we satisfy our own needs for validation and belonging. Empirical results reject the hypothesis often implied in economics that we are 95% selfish.\nRelation with civil society\n[edit]Various authors give definitions of civil society that refer to voluntary associations and organisations outside the market and state.[74][107][108][109] This definition is very close to that of the third sector, which consists of \"private organisations that are formed and sustained by groups of people acting voluntarily and without seeking personal profit to provide benefits for themselves or for others.\"[citation needed]\nAccording to such authors as Walzer (1992), Alessandrini (2002),[74] Newtown, Stolle & Rochon, Foley & Edwards (1997),[46] and Walters, it is through civil society, or more accurately, the third sector, that individuals are able to establish and maintain relational networks. These voluntary associations also connect people with each other, build trust and reciprocity through informal, loosely structured associations, and consolidate society through altruism without obligation. It is \"this range of activities, services and associations produced by... civil society\" that constitutes the sources of social capital.[74]\nNot only has civil society been documented to produce sources of social capital, according to Lyons' Third Sector (2001),[110] social capital does not appear in any guise under either the factors that enable or those that stimulate the growth of the third sector. Likewise, Onyx (2000) describes how social capital depends on an already functioning community.[111] The idea that creating social capital (i.e., creating networks) will strengthen civil society underlies current Australian social policy aimed at bridging deepening social divisions. The goal is to reintegrate those marginalised from the rewards of the economic system into \"the community.\" However, according to Onyx (2000), while the explicit aim of this policy is inclusion, its effects are exclusionary.\nFoley and Edwards (1997) believe that \"political systems...are important determinants of both the character of civil society and of the uses to which whatever social capital exists might be put.\"[46] Alessandrini agrees, saying that, \"in Australia in particular, neo-liberalism has been recast as economic rationalism and identified by several theorists and commentators as a danger to society at large because of the use to which they are putting social capital to work.\"[74]\nThe resurgence of interest in social capital as a remedy for the cause of today's social problems draws directly on the assumption that these problems lie in the weakening of civil society. However this ignores the arguments of many theorists who believe that social capital leads to exclusion rather than to a stronger civil society.[citation needed] In international development, Ben Fine (2001) and John Harriss (2001) have been heavily critical of the inappropriate adoption of social capital as a supposed panacea (promoting civil society organisations and NGOs, for example, as agents of development) for the inequalities generated by neoliberal economic development.[112][113] This leads to controversy as to the role of state institutions in the promotion of social capital. An abundance of social capital is seen as being almost a necessary condition for modern liberal democracy. A low level of social capital leads to an excessively rigid and unresponsive political system and high levels of corruption, in the political system and in the region as a whole. Formal public institutions require social capital in order to function properly, and while it is possible to have too much social capital (resulting in rapid changes and excessive regulation), it is decidedly worse to have too little.\nSample societies\n[edit]Post-Communist: Kathleen Dowley and Brian Silver published an article entitled \"Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States\", in which they find that in post-communist states, higher levels of social capital did not equate to higher levels of democracy. However, higher levels of social capital led to higher support for democracy.[114]\nThird-world: A number of intellectuals in developing countries have argued that the idea of social capital, particularly when connected to certain ideas about civil society, is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor and NGO-driven imperialism and that it functions, primarily, to blame the poor for their condition.[115]\nChinese: The concept of social capital in a Chinese social context has been closely linked with the concept of guanxi.\nAmerican: One attempt to measure social capital, involving the quantity, quality and strength of an individual social capital, was spearheaded by Corporate Alliance in the English-speaking market segment of the US,[116] and Xentrum through the Latin American Chamber of Commerce in Utah on the Spanish-speaking population of the same country.[117][118] With the assistance of software applications and web-based relationship-oriented systems such as LinkedIn, these kinds of organizations are expected to provide its members with a way to keep track of the number of their relationships, meetings designed to boost the strength of each relationship using group dynamics, executive retreats and networking events as well as training in how to reach out to higher circles of influential people.\nEffects on women's engagement with politics\n[edit]There are many factors that drive volume towards the ballot box, including education, employment, civil skills, and time. Careful evaluation of these fundamental factors often suggests that women do not vote at similar levels as men. However the gap between women and men voter turnout is diminishing and in some cases women are becoming more prevalent at the ballot box than their male counterparts. Recent research on social capital is now serving as an explanation for this change.[119]\nSocial capital offers a wealth of resources and networks that facilitate political engagement. Since social capital is readily available no matter the type of community, it is able to override more traditional queues for political engagement; e.g.: education, employment, civil skills, etc.\nThere are unique ways in which women organize. These differences from men make social capital more personable and impressionable to women audiences thus creating a stronger presence in regards to political engagement. A few examples of these characteristics are:\n- Women's informal and formal networks tend toward care work that is often considered apolitical.[120]\n- Women are also more likely to engage in local politics and social movement activities than in traditional forums focused on national politics.[121]\n- Women are more likely to organize themselves in less hierarchical ways and to focus on creating consensus.[120]\nThe often informal nature of female social capital allows women to politicize apolitical environments without conforming to masculine standards, thus keeping this activity at a low public profile. These differences are hard to recognize within the discourse of political engagement and may explain why social capital has not been considered as a tool for female political engagement until as of late.[119]\nEffects on health\n[edit]A growing body of research has found that the presence of social capital through social networks and communities has a protective quality on health. Social capital affects health risk behavior in the sense that individuals who are embedded in a network or community rich in support, social trust, information, and norms, have resources that help achieve health goals.[122] For example, a person who is sick with cancer may receive the information, money, or moral support needed to endure treatment and recover. Social capital also encourages social trust and membership. These factors can discourage individuals from engaging in risky health behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking.[123]\nFurthermore, neighbourhood social capital may also aid in buffering health inequities amongst children and adolescents.[124][125] Social capital indicators such as neighbourhood cohesion, social support, and ties providing a bond between members of the same religion, have been found to be associated with better health despite financial or socioeconomic hardship.[126] The function of social capital as a health buffer in circumstances of social disadvantage has also received attention in research on the health of minority ethnic populations. The relationships and networks that are maintained by an ethnic minority population in a geographical area where a high percentage of residents belong to the same ethnic group may lead to better health outcomes than would be expected based on other individual and neighbourhood characteristics. Such effects have been investigated in England,[127] New Zealand,[128] and the United States.[129]\nInversely, a lack of social capital can impair health. For example, results from a survey given to 13- to 18-year-old students in Sweden showed that low social capital and low social trust are associated with higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and depression.[130] Additionally, negative social capital can detract from health. Although there are only a few studies that assess social capital in criminalized populations, there is information that suggests that social capital does have a negative effect in broken communities. Deviant behavior is encouraged by deviant peers via favorable definitions and learning opportunities provided by network-based norms.[131] However, in these same communities, an adjustment of norms (i.e. deviant peers being replaced by positive role models) can pose a positive effect. Researchers have also investigated the hypothesis that the health benefits of social capital depend on the socioeconomic resources an individual or community has available to them. For example, social capital may boost health only for those with higher levels of education, or more so for those with a higher rather than a lower income.[126] This research is based on Bourdieu's notion that social, economic, and cultural capital are dependent on each other.[18]\nInfluence of the Internet\n[edit]Similar to watching the news and keeping abreast of current events, the use of the Internet can relate to an individual's level of social capital. In one study, informational uses of the Internet correlated positively with an individual's production of social capital, and social-recreational uses were negatively correlated (higher levels of these uses correlated with lower levels of social capital).[132] An example supporting the former argument is the contribution of Peter Maranci's blog (Charlie on the Commuter Line) to address the train problems in Massachusetts. He created it after an incident where a lady passed out during a train ride due to the congestion in the train and help was delayed because of the congestion in the train and the inefficiency of the train conductor. His blog exposed the poor conditions of train stations, overcrowding train rides and inefficiency of the train conductor which eventually influenced changes within the transit system.[clarification needed][133]\nAnother perspective holds that the rapid growth of social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace suggests that individuals are creating a virtual-network consisting of both bonding and bridging social capital. Unlike face to face interaction, people can instantly connect with others in a targeted fashion by placing specific parameters with Internet use. This means that individuals can selectively connect with others based on ascertained interests, and backgrounds. Facebook is currently the most popular social networking site and touts many advantages to its users including serving as a social lubricant for individuals who otherwise have difficulties forming and maintaining both strong and weak ties with others.[134][135]\nThis argument continues, although the preponderance of evidence shows a positive association between social capital and the Internet. Critics of virtual communities believe that the Internet replaces our strong bonds with online \"weak-ties\"[136] or with socially empty interactions with the technology itself.[137] Others fear that the Internet can create a world of \"narcissism of similarity,\" where sociability is reduced to interactions between those that are similar in terms of ideology, race, or gender.[138] A few articles suggest that technologically based interactions has a negative relationship with social capital by displacing time spent engaging in geographical/ in-person social activities.[136] However, the consensus of research shows that the more time people spend online the more in-person contact they have, thus positively enhancing social capital.[135][139][140][141][142]\nRecent research, conducted in 2006, also shows that Internet users often have wider networks than those who access the Internet irregularly or not at all. When not considering family and work contacts, Internet users actually tend to have contact with a higher number of friends and relatives.[143] This is supported by another study that shows that Internet users and non-Internet users do feel equally close to the same number of people; also the Internet users maintain relationships with 20% more people whom they \"feel somewhat close\" to.[140]\nOther research shows that younger people use the Internet as a supplemental medium for communication, rather than letting the Internet communication replace face-to-face contact.[144] This supports the view that Internet communication does not hinder development of social capital and does not make people feel lonelier than before.\nEllison, Steinfield & Lampe (2007) suggest social capital exercised online is a result of relationships formed offline; whereby, bridging capital is enabled through a \"maintenance\" of relationships. Among respondents of this study, social capital built exclusively online creates weaker ties.[145] A distinction of social bonding is offered by Ellison et al., 2007, suggesting bonds, or strong ties, are possible through social media, but less likely.\nConversely, in the afterword to the second edition of Bowling Alone (2020), political scientist Robert D. Putnam found that the expansion of internet access, social media, social networking services, online dating services, professional networking services, and e-commerce was probably accelerating the decline in social capital among the U.S. population that began in the 1960s, while mostly just reinforcing existing social connections rather than creating new ones (i.e. bonding social capital versus bridging social capital)—analogously to the effect that the expansion of telephone ownership by U.S. households had (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1890 to a majority by 1946 and to 75 percent by 1957).[146][147][148]\nIn the first edition of Bowling Alone (2000), Putnam found that the social capital decline was caused primarily by the expansion of television ownership by U.S. households (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1948 to 75 percent by 1955), the gradual replacement of the Greatest Generation and Silent Generation birth year cohorts by the Baby boomer and Generation X birth year cohorts, and the effect of the television ownership expansion on Baby boomers and Generation X.[149][150][151] Putnam anticipated that if internet use resembled television and telephone use that the impact of the internet on social capital would largely be the same as the television and the telephone, but Putnam rejected technological determinism in suggesting that the impacts of the internet on social capital was not inevitable and would depend on how Americans collectively chose to use the internet.[152] With respect to political and civic engagement specifically, Putnam referenced meta-analyses and other research in political science in the second edition of Bowling Alone that concluded that the effects of social networking services and social media on political and civic participation was minimal or negative.[153]\nWhen considered with the use of social media for passive observation or online-only and low-effort support of political and social movements, Putnam concluded that the relationship between internet activism and offline activism is correlational rather than causal in light of research about pre-internet political and social movements (such as the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War in the United States and the 1989 Peaceful Revolution in East Germany) showing that personal connections with other activists are a stronger predictor of which individuals remain part of a movement rather than ideological commitment.[154] Instead, Putnam argued that the weight of the research showed that social media has exacerbated political polarization in the United States due to ideological and socioeconomic homophily among user social networks and social media algorithms that promote echo chambers, virtue signalling, and disinformation.[155] However, Putnam also suggested that these effects of social media owed to the surveillance capitalism business models of the companies that operated the services rather than the technology itself, which created incentives for the companies to promote consumerism rather than building social capital and social trust.[156]\nEffects on educational achievement\n[edit]Catholic schools (Coleman and Hoffer)\n[edit]Coleman and Hoffer collected quantitative data of 28,000 students in total 1,015 public, Catholic and other private high schools in America from the 7 years' period from 1980 to 1987.[157] It was found from this longitudinal research that social capital in students' families and communities attributed to the much lower dropout rates in Catholic schools compared with the higher rates in public.\nTeachman et al. (1996) further develop the family structure indicator suggested by Coleman. They criticise Coleman, who used only the number of parents present in the family, neglected the unseen effect of more discrete dimensions such as stepparents' and different types of single-parent families. They take into account of a detailed counting of family structure, not only with two biological parents or stepparent families, but also with types of single-parent families with each other (mother-only, father-only, never-married, and other). They also contribute to the literature by measuring parent-child interaction by the indicators of how often parents and children discuss school-related activities.[158]\nMorgan and Sorensen (1999) directly challenge Coleman for his lacking of an explicit mechanism to explain why Catholic schools students perform better than public school students on standardised tests of achievement.[159] Researching students in Catholic schools and public schools again, they propose two comparable models of social capital effect on mathematic learning. One is on Catholic schools as norm-enforcing schools whereas another is on public schools as horizon-expanding schools. It is found that while social capital can bring about positive effect of maintaining an encompassing functional community in norm-enforcing schools, it also brings about the negative consequence of excessive monitoring. Creativity and exceptional achievement would be repressed as a result. Whereas in horizon expanding school, social closure is found to be negative for student's mathematic achievement. These schools explore a different type of social capital, such as information about opportunities in the extended social networks of parents and other adults. The consequence is that more learning is fostered than norm-enforcing Catholic school students. In sum, Morgan and Sorensen study implies that social capital is contextualised, one kind of social capital may be positive in this setting but is not necessarily still positive in another setting.[160]\nCommunity development\n[edit]In the setting of education through Kilpatrick, Johns, and Mulford (2010) state that \"social capital is a useful lens for analysing lifelong learning and its relationship to community development.\"[161] Social capital is particularly important in terms of education. Also the importance of education with \"schools being designed to create 'functioning community' - forging tighter links between parents and the school\" linking that without this interaction, the social capital in this area is disadvantaged and demonstrates that social capital plays a major role in education.[157]\nParental involvement\n[edit]Putnam (2000) mentions in his book Bowling Alone, \"Child development is powerfully shaped by social capital\" and continues \"presence of social capital has been linked to various positive outcomes, particularly in education.\"[24]: 296 According to his book, these positive outcomes are the result of parents' social capital in a community. In states where there is a high social capital, there is also a high education performance.[24]: 300 The similarity of these states is that parents were more associated with their children's education. Teachers have reported that when the parents participate more in their children's education and school life, it lowers levels of misbehavior, such as bringing weapons to school, engaging in physical violence, unauthorized absence, and being generally apathetic about education.[24]: 301 Borrowing Coleman's quotation from Putnam's book, Coleman once mentioned we cannot understate \"the importance of the embeddedness of young persons in the enclaves of adults most proximate to them, first and most prominent the family and second, a surrounding community of adults.\"[24]: 303\nWithout social capital in the area of education, teachers and parents who play a responsibility in a students learning, the significant impacts on their child's academic learning can rely on these factors. With focus on parents contributing to their child's academic progress as well as being influenced by social capital in education. Without the contribution by the parent in their child's education, gives parents less opportunity and participation in the student's life. As Tedin and Weiher (2010)[162] state, \"one of the most important factors in promoting student success is the active involvement of parents in a child's education.\" With parents also involved in activities and meetings the school conducts, the more involved parents are with other parents and the staff members. Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community.\nSampson et al. (1999) stress the normative or goal-directed dimension of social capital,[163] claiming that \"resources or networks alone (e.g. voluntary associations, friendship ties, organisational density) are neutral---they may or may not be effective mechanism for achieving intended effect.\"[164]\nDifference in male and female\n[edit]Marjoribanks and Kwok (1998) conducted a survey in Hong Kong secondary schools with 387 fourteen-year-old students with an aim to analyse female and male adolescents differential educational achievement by using social capital as the main analytic tool. In that research, social capital is approved of its different effects upon different genders.[165]\nAdaption and ethnic values\n[edit]In his thesis \"New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance\", Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) argues that adaptation is a process of activation and accumulation of (cultural and social) capitals. The research findings show that supportive networks is the key determinant differentiating the divergent adaptation pathways. Supportive networks, as a form of social capital, is necessary for activating the cultural capital the newly arrived students possessed. The amount of accumulated capital is also relevant to further advancement in the ongoing adaptation process.[166]\nMin Zhou and Carl L. Bankston (1998), in their study of a Vietnamese community in New Orleans, found that preserving traditional ethnic values enable immigrants to integrate socially and to maintain solidarity in an ethnic community.[167] Ethnic solidarity is especially important in the context where immigrants just arrive in the host society.[69] In her article \"Social Capital in Chinatown\", Zhou examines how the process of adaptation of young Chinese Americans is affected by tangible forms of social relations between the community, immigrant families, and the younger generations.[168] Chinatown serves as the basis of social capital that facilitates the accommodation of immigrant children in the expected directions. Ethnic support provides impetus to academic success. Furthermore, maintenance of literacy in native language also provides a form of social capital that contributes positively to academic achievement. Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch[169] found that bilingual students were more likely to obtain the necessary forms of institutional support to advance their school performance and their life chances.\nIn fields of study\n[edit]Geography\n[edit]In order to understand social capital as a subject in geography, one must look at it in a sense of space, place, and territory. In its relationship, the tenets[who?] of geography relate to the ideas of social capital in the family, community, and in the use of social networks. The biggest advocate for seeing social capital as a geographical subject was American economist and political scientist Robert Putnam. His main argument for classifying social capital as a geographical concept is that the relationships of people is shaped and molded by the areas in which they live.[170]\nThere are many areas in which social capital can be defined by the theories and practices. In 1984, Anthony Giddens developed a theory in which he relates social structures and the actions that they produce. In his studies, he does not look at the individual participants of these structures, but how the structures and the social connections that stem from them are diffused over space.[171] If this is the case, the continuous change in social structures could bring about a change in social capital, which can cause changes in community atmosphere. If an area is plagued by social organizations whose goals are to revolt against social norms, such as gangs, it can cause a negative social capital for the area causing those who disagreed with these organizations to relocate thus taking their positive social capital to a different space than the negative.\nAnother area where social capital can be seen as an area of study in geography is through the analysis of participation in volunteerism and its support of different governments. One area to look into with this is through those who participate in social organizations. People that participate are of different races, ages, and economic status.[172] With these in mind, variances of the space in which these different demographics may vary, causing a difference in involvement among areas. Secondly, there are different social programs for different areas based on economic situation.[172] A governmental organization would not place a welfare center in a wealthier neighborhood where it would have very limited support to the community, as it is not needed. Thirdly, social capital can be affected by the participation of individuals of a certain area based on the type of institutions that are placed there.[172] Mohan supports this with the argument of J. Fox in his paper \"Decentralization and Rural Development in Mexico\", which states \"structures of local governance in turn influence the capacity of grassroots communities to influence social investments.\"[173] With this theory, if the involvement of a government in specific areas raises the involvement of individuals in social organizations and/or communities, this will in turn raise the social capital for that area. Since every area is different, the government takes that into consideration and will provide different areas with different institutions to fit their needs thus there will be different changes in social capital in different areas.\nLeisure studies\n[edit]In the context of leisure studies, social capital is seen as the consequence of investment in and cultivation of social relationships allowing an individual access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable to him or her.[174] The concept of social capital in relation to leisure is grounded in a perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness rather than the separateness of human activity and human goals. There is a significant connection between leisure and democratic social capital.[175] Specific forms of leisure activity contribute to the development of the social capital central to democracy and democratic citizenship. The more an individual participates in social activities, the more autonomy the individual experiences, which will help her or his individual abilities and skills to develop. The greater the accumulation of social capital a person experiences, may transfer to other leisure activities as well as personal social roles, relationships and in other roles within a social structure.[175]\nSocial capital, marriage, and romantic relationships\n[edit]Kislev (2019) shows that following vast changes to the status of marriage in modern society singles present higher social capital. They also derive greater happiness from equal levels of social capital compared with married people.[176] In a later study, Kislev (2020) shows the relation between romantic relationships desire and singleness. He shows that a lower degree of relationship desire has a significant effect on the relative importance of friends. Furthermore, both higher levels of the relative importance of friends and social satisfaction are negatively correlated with relationship desire.[177]\nEffects on informal economies\n[edit]Social capital has been associated with the reduction in access to informal credit in informal economies (especially in developing countries).[citation needed] Social capital in rural communities bring business-related knowledge and skills, entrepreneurial wellbeing, and economic benefits for individuals within communities, while for the community as a whole, strong social capital also brings extra shared economic benefits, and it can also foster socio-cultural change within the community.[178]\nSimilar results were revealed in a cross-sectional study run by Sarker in Bangladesh.[179] Some other authors also note the importance of social capital among female entrepreneurship. Epo (2013) presented the case that social capital and micro loans increase the likelihood of female entrepreneurship in Cameroon.[180] Epo did this by comparing the welfare outcomes of the entrepreneurs who both had access and no access. Other authors, however, disagree about the positive correlation between social capital and microfinance, Kanak and Iiguni argue that formation of social capital is largely dependent on strategies implemented by Microfinance Institutions.[citation needed] Kanak and Iiguni determined this while investigating social capital formation in a rural village in Bangladesh.\nFor their study in Indian rural communities, Trivedi and colleagues make a distinction between internal social capital, i.e. within a rural community, and external social capital, i.e., between people from the community with people outside the community. They argue that both internal and external social capital need to be in place for a rural community to create entrepreneurial and economic benefits, which in turn can reduce poverty.[178]\nSee also\n[edit]- Cultural economics – Branch of economics\n- Diplomatic capital\n- Intellectual capital management\n- Organisational capital\n- Organization workshop – Business education workshop\n- Political capital – Means by which a politician or political party may gain support or popularity\n- Reed's law – Increase in utility with network size\n- Relational capital\n- Reputation – Social opinion about an entity\n- Sexual capital – Social value from sexual attractiveness\n- Social currency – Sociological concept\n- Soft power – Ability to co-opt rather than coerce\n- Structural capital – Primary component of intellectual capital\n- True cost accounting – Accounting that measures the hidden impacts of economic activities on the environment\n- Trust capital\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Social Capital | Definition of Social Capital by Oxford Dictionary on Lexico.com also meaning of Social Capital\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_analysis", "title": "Link analysis - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Link analysis\nIn network theory, link analysis is a data-analysis technique used to evaluate relationships between nodes. Relationships may be identified among various types of nodes, including organizations, people and transactions. Link analysis has been used for investigation of criminal activity (fraud, counterterrorism, and intelligence), computer security analysis, search engine optimization, market research, medical research, and art.\nKnowledge discovery\n[edit]Knowledge discovery is an iterative and interactive process used to identify, analyze and visualize patterns in data.[1] Network analysis, link analysis and social network analysis are all methods of knowledge discovery, each a corresponding subset of the prior method. Most knowledge discovery methods follow these steps (at the highest level):[2]\nData gathering and processing requires access to data and has several inherent issues, including information overload and data errors. Once data is collected, it will need to be transformed into a format that can be effectively used by both human and computer analyzers. Manual or computer-generated visualizations tools may be mapped from the data, including network charts. Several algorithms exist to help with analysis of data – Dijkstra's algorithm, breadth-first search, and depth-first search.\nLink analysis focuses on analysis of relationships among nodes through visualization methods (network charts, association matrix). Here is an example of the relationships that may be mapped for crime investigations:[3]\n| Relationship/Network | Data Sources |\n|---|---|\n| 1. Trust | Prior contacts in family, neighborhood, school, military, club or organization. Public and court records. Data may only be available in suspect's native country. |\n| 2. Task | Logs and records of phone calls, electronic mail, chat rooms, instant messages, Web site visits. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. |\n| 3. Money & Resources | Bank account and money transfer records. Pattern and location of credit card use. Prior court records. Human intelligence: observation of visits to alternate banking resources such as Hawala. |\n| 4. Strategy & Goals | Web sites. Videos and encrypted disks delivered by courier. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. |\nLink analysis is used for 3 primary purposes:[4]\n- Find matches in data for known patterns of interest;\n- Find anomalies where known patterns are violated;\n- Discover new patterns of interest (social network analysis, data mining).\nHistory\n[edit]Klerks categorized link analysis tools into 3 generations.[5] The first generation was introduced in 1975 as the Anacpapa Chart of Harper and Harris.[6] This method requires that a domain expert review data files, identify associations by constructing an association matrix, create a link chart for visualization and finally analyze the network chart to identify patterns of interest. This method requires extensive domain knowledge and is extremely time-consuming when reviewing vast amounts of data.\nIn addition to the association matrix, the activities matrix can be used to produce actionable information, which has practical value and use to law-enforcement. The activities matrix, as the term might imply, centers on the actions and activities of people with respect to locations. Whereas the association matrix focuses on the relationships between people, organizations, and/or properties. The distinction between these two types of matrices, while minor, is nonetheless significant in terms of the output of the analysis completed or rendered.[7][8][9][10]\nSecond generation tools consist of automatic graphics-based analysis tools such as IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook, Netmap, ClueMaker and Watson. These tools offer the ability to automate the construction and updates of the link chart once an association matrix is manually created, however, analysis of the resulting charts and graphs still requires an expert with extensive domain knowledge.\nThe third generation of link-analysis tools like DataWalk allow the automatic visualization of linkages between elements in a data set, that can then serve as the canvas for further exploration or manual updates.\nApplications\n[edit]- FBI Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP)\n- Iowa State Sex Crimes Analysis System\n- Minnesota State Sex Crimes Analysis System (MIN/SCAP)\n- Washington State Homicide Investigation Tracking System (HITS)[11]\n- New York State Homicide Investigation & Lead Tracking (HALT)\n- New Jersey Homicide Evaluation & Assessment Tracking (HEAT)[12]\n- Pennsylvania State ATAC Program.\n- Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS)[13]\nIssues with link analysis\n[edit]Information overload\n[edit]With the vast amounts of data and information that are stored electronically, users are confronted with multiple unrelated sources of information available for analysis. Data analysis techniques are required to make effective and efficient use of the data. Palshikar classifies data analysis techniques into two categories – (statistical models, time-series analysis, clustering and classification, matching algorithms to detect anomalies) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (data mining, expert systems, pattern recognition, machine learning techniques, neural networks).[14]\nBolton & Hand define statistical data analysis as either supervised or unsupervised methods.[15] Supervised learning methods require that rules are defined within the system to establish what is expected or unexpected behavior. Unsupervised learning methods review data in comparison to the norm and detect statistical outliers. Supervised learning methods are limited in the scenarios that can be handled as this method requires that training rules are established based on previous patterns. Unsupervised learning methods can provide detection of broader issues, however, may result in a higher false-positive ratio if the behavioral norm is not well established or understood.\nData itself has inherent issues including integrity (or lack of) and continuous changes. Data may contain \"errors of omission and commission because of faulty collection or handling, and when entities are actively attempting to deceive and/or conceal their actions\".[4] Sparrow[16] highlights incompleteness (inevitability of missing data or links), fuzzy boundaries (subjectivity in deciding what to include) and dynamic changes (recognition that data is ever-changing) as the three primary problems with data analysis.[3]\nOnce data is transformed into a usable format, open texture and cross referencing issues may arise. Open texture was defined by Waismann as the unavoidable uncertainty in meaning when empirical terms are used in different contexts.[17] Uncertainty in meaning of terms presents problems when attempting to search and cross reference data from multiple sources.[18]\nThe primary method for resolving data analysis issues is reliance on domain knowledge from an expert. This is a very time-consuming and costly method of conducting link analysis and has inherent problems of its own. McGrath et al. conclude that the layout and presentation of a network diagram have a significant impact on the user's \"perceptions of the existence of groups in networks\".[19] Even using domain experts may result in differing conclusions as analysis may be subjective.\nProsecution vs. crime prevention\n[edit]Link analysis techniques have primarily been used for prosecution, as it is far easier to review historical data for patterns than it is to attempt to predict future actions.\nKrebs demonstrated the use of an association matrix and link chart of the terrorist network associated with the 19 hijackers responsible for the September 11th attacks by mapping publicly available details made available following the attacks.[3] Even with the advantages of hindsight and publicly available information on people, places and transactions, it is clear that there is missing data.\nAlternatively, Picarelli argued that use of link analysis techniques could have been used to identify and potentially prevent illicit activities within the Aum Shinrikyo network.[20] \"We must be careful of 'guilt by association'. Being linked to a terrorist does not prove guilt – but it does invite investigation.\"[3] Balancing the legal concepts of probable cause, right to privacy and freedom of association become challenging when reviewing potentially sensitive data with the objective to prevent crime or illegal activity that has not yet occurred.\nProposed solutions\n[edit]There are four categories of proposed link analysis solutions:[21]\n- Heuristic-based\n- Template-based\n- Similarity-based\n- Statistical\nHeuristic-based tools utilize decision rules that are distilled from expert knowledge using structured data. Template-based tools employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract details from unstructured data that are matched to pre-defined templates. Similarity-based approaches use weighted scoring to compare attributes and identify potential links. Statistical approaches identify potential links based on lexical statistics.\nCrimeNet explorer\n[edit]J.J. Xu and H. Chen propose a framework for automated network analysis and visualization called CrimeNet Explorer.[22] This framework includes the following elements:\n- Network Creation through a concept space approach that uses \"co-occurrence weight to measure the frequency with which two words or phrases appear in the same document. The more frequently two words or phrases appear together, the more likely it will be that they are related\".[22]\n- Network Partition using \"hierarchical clustering to partition a network into subgroups based on relational strength\".[22]\n- Structural Analysis through \"three centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and closeness) to identify central members in a given subgroup.[22] CrimeNet Explorer employed Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm to calculate the betweenness and closeness from a single node to all other nodes in the subgroup.\n- Network Visualization using Torgerson's metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Inc., The Tor Project. \"Tor Project: Overview\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization", "title": "Combinatorial optimization - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Combinatorial optimization\nCombinatorial optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects,[1] where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a discrete set. Typical combinatorial optimization problems are the travelling salesman problem (\"TSP\"), the minimum spanning tree problem (\"MST\"), and the knapsack problem. In many such problems, such as the ones previously mentioned, exhaustive search is not tractable, and so specialized algorithms that quickly rule out large parts of the search space or approximation algorithms must be resorted to instead.\nCombinatorial optimization is related to operations research, algorithm theory, and computational complexity theory. It has important applications in several fields, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, auction theory, software engineering, VLSI, applied mathematics and theoretical computer science.\nApplications\n[edit]Basic applications of combinatorial optimization include, but are not limited to:\n- Logistics[2]\n- Supply chain optimization[3]\n- Developing the best airline network of spokes and destinations\n- Deciding which taxis in a fleet to route to pick up fares\n- Determining the optimal way to deliver packages\n- Allocating jobs to people optimally\n- Designing water distribution networks\n- Earth science problems (e.g. reservoir flow-rates)[4]\nMethods\n[edit]There is a large amount of literature on polynomial-time algorithms for certain special classes of discrete optimization. A considerable amount of it is unified by the theory of linear programming. Some examples of combinatorial optimization problems that are covered by this framework are shortest paths and shortest-path trees, flows and circulations, spanning trees, matching, and matroid problems.\nFor NP-complete discrete optimization problems, current research literature includes the following topics:\n- polynomial-time exactly solvable special cases of the problem at hand (e.g. fixed-parameter tractable problems)\n- algorithms that perform well on \"random\" instances (e.g. for the traveling salesman problem)\n- approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time and find a solution that is close to optimal\n- parameterized approximation algorithms that run in FPT time and find a solution close to the optimum\n- solving real-world instances that arise in practice and do not necessarily exhibit the worst-case behavior of in NP-complete problems (e.g. real-world TSP instances with tens of thousands of nodes[5]).\nCombinatorial optimization problems can be viewed as searching for the best element of some set of discrete items; therefore, in principle, any sort of search algorithm or metaheuristic can be used to solve them. Widely applicable approaches include branch-and-bound (an exact algorithm which can be stopped at any point in time to serve as heuristic), branch-and-cut (uses linear optimisation to generate bounds), dynamic programming (a recursive solution construction with limited search window) and tabu search (a greedy-type swapping algorithm). However, generic search algorithms are not guaranteed to find an optimal solution first, nor are they guaranteed to run quickly (in polynomial time). Since some discrete optimization problems are NP-complete, such as the traveling salesman (decision) problem,[6] this is expected unless P=NP.\nFor each combinatorial optimization problem, there is a corresponding decision problem that asks whether there is a feasible solution for some particular measure . For example, if there is a graph which contains vertices and , an optimization problem might be \"find a path from to that uses the fewest edges\". This problem might have an answer of, say, 4. A corresponding decision problem would be \"is there a path from to that uses 10 or fewer edges?\" This problem can be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'.\nThe field of approximation algorithms deals with algorithms to find near-optimal solutions to hard problems. The usual decision version is then an inadequate definition of the problem since it only specifies acceptable solutions. Even though we could introduce suitable decision problems, the problem is then more naturally characterized as an optimization problem.[7]\nNP optimization problem\n[edit]An NP-optimization problem (NPO) is a combinatorial optimization problem with the following additional conditions.[8] Note that the below referred polynomials are functions of the size of the respective functions' inputs, not the size of some implicit set of input instances.\n- the size of every feasible solution , where denotes the set of feasible solutions to instance , is polynomially bounded in the size of the given instance ,\n- the languages of valid instances and of valid instance–solution pairs can be recognized in polynomial time, and\n- The measure of a solution to problem is polynomial-time computable.\nThis implies that the corresponding decision problem is in NP. In computer science, interesting optimization problems usually have the above properties and are therefore NPO problems. A problem is additionally called a P-optimization (PO) problem, if there exists an algorithm which finds optimal solutions in polynomial time. Often, when dealing with the class NPO, one is interested in optimization problems for which the decision versions are NP-complete. Note that hardness relations are always with respect to some reduction. Due to the connection between approximation algorithms and computational optimization problems, reductions which preserve approximation in some respect are for this subject preferred than the usual Turing and Karp reductions. An example of such a reduction would be L-reduction. For this reason, optimization problems with NP-complete decision versions are not necessarily called NPO-complete.[9]\nNPO is divided into the following subclasses according to their approximability:[8]\n- NPO(I): Equals FPTAS. Contains the Knapsack problem.\n- NPO(II): Equals PTAS. Contains the Makespan scheduling problem.\n- NPO(III): The class of NPO problems that have polynomial-time algorithms which computes solutions with a cost at most c times the optimal cost (for minimization problems) or a cost at least of the optimal cost (for maximization problems). In Hromkovič's book Algorithms for Hard Problems, excluded from this class are all NPO(II)-problems save if P=NP.[8] Without the exclusion, equals APX. Contains MAX-SAT and metric TSP.\n- NPO(IV): The class of NPO problems with polynomial-time algorithms approximating the optimal solution by a ratio that is polynomial in a logarithm of the size of the input. In Hromkovič's book, all NPO(III)-problems are excluded from this class unless P=NP. Contains the set cover problem.\n- NPO(V): The class of NPO problems with polynomial-time algorithms approximating the optimal solution by a ratio bounded by some function on n. In Hromkovic's book, all NPO(IV)-problems are excluded from this class unless P=NP. Contains the TSP and clique problem.\nAn NPO problem is called polynomially bounded (PB) if, for every instance and for every solution , the measure is bounded by a polynomial function of the size of . The class NPOPB is the class of NPO problems that are polynomially-bounded.\nSpecific problems\n[edit]- Assignment problem\n- Bin packing problem\n- Chinese postman problem\n- Closure problem\n- Constraint satisfaction problem\n- Cutting stock problem\n- Dominating set problem\n- Integer programming\n- Job shop scheduling\n- Knapsack problem\n- Metric k-center / vertex k-center problem\n- Minimum relevant variables in linear system\n- Minimum spanning tree\n- Nurse scheduling problem\n- Ring star problem\n- Set cover problem\n- Talent scheduling\n- Traveling salesman problem\n- Vehicle rescheduling problem\n- Vehicle routing problem\n- Weapon target assignment problem\nSee also\n[edit]- Constraint composite graph – Node-weighted undirected graph associated with a given combinatorial optimization problem\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ Schrijver 2003, p. 1.\n- ^ Sbihi, Abdelkader; Eglese, Richard W.

This problem is fundamental for several reasons. First, in the networks that transport information or material (such as email networks,[2] World Wide Web (WWW),[3] World Trade Web,[4] or Wikipedia[5] ), mutual links facilitate the transportation process. Second, when analyzing directed networks, people often treat them as undirected ones for simplicity; therefore, the information obtained from reciprocity studies helps to estimate the error introduced when a directed network is treated as undirected (for example, when measuring the clustering coefficient). Finally, detecting nontrivial patterns of reciprocity can reveal possible mechanisms and organizing principles that shape the observed network's topology.[1]\nDefinitions\n[edit]Traditional definition\n[edit]A traditional way to define the reciprocity is using the ratio of the number of links pointing in both directions to the total number of links L [6]\nWith this definition, is for a purely bidirectional network while for a purely unidirectional one. Real networks have an intermediate value between 0 and 1.\nHowever, this definition of reciprocity has some defects. It cannot tell the relative difference of reciprocity compared with purely random network with the same number of vertices and edges. The useful information from reciprocity is not the value itself, but whether mutual links occur more or less often than expected by chance. Besides, in those networks containing self-linking loops (links starting and ending at the same vertex), the self-linking loops should be excluded when calculating .\nGarlaschelli and Loffredo's definition\n[edit]In order to overcome the defects of the above definition, Garlaschelli and Loffredo defined reciprocity as the correlation coefficient between the entries of the adjacency matrix of a directed graph ( if a link from to exists, and if not):\n,\nwhere the average value .\nmeasures the ratio of observed to possible directed links (link density), and self-linking loops are now excluded from since is not equal to .\nThe definition can be written in the following simple form:\nThe new definition of reciprocity gives an absolute quantity which directly allows one to distinguish between reciprocal () and antireciprocal () networks, with mutual links occurring more and less often than random respectively.\nIf all the links occur in reciprocal pairs, ; if , .\nThis is another advantage of using , since it incorporates the idea that complete antireciprocality is more statistically significant in networks with larger density, while it must be regarded as a less pronounced effect in sparser networks.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b Diego Garlaschelli; Loffredo, Maria I.

In general terms, cognitive balance refers to the propensity of two individuals to want to feel the same way about an object. If the triad of three individuals is not closed, then the person connected to both of the individuals will want to close this triad in order to achieve closure in the relationship network.\nMeasurements\n[edit]The two most common measures of triadic closure for a graph are (in no particular order) the clustering coefficient and transitivity for that graph.\nClustering coefficient\n[edit]One measure for the presence of triadic closure is clustering coefficient, as follows:\nLet be an undirected simple graph (i.e., a graph having no self-loops or multiple edges) with V the set of vertices and E the set of edges. Also, let and denote the number of vertices and edges in G, respectively, and let be the degree of vertex i.\nWe can define a triangle among the triple of vertices , , and to be a set with the following three edges: {(i,j), (j,k), (i,k)}.\nWe can also define the number of triangles that vertex is involved in as and, as each triangle is counted three times, we can express the number of triangles in G as .\nAssuming that triadic closure holds, only two strong edges are required for a triple to form. Thus, the number of theoretical triples that should be present under the triadic closure hypothesis for a vertex is , assuming . We can express .\nNow, for a vertex with , the clustering coefficient of vertex is the fraction of triples for vertex that are closed, and can be measured as . Thus, the clustering coefficient of graph is given by , where is the number of nodes with degree at least 2.\nTransitivity\n[edit]Another measure for the presence of triadic closure is transitivity, defined as .\nCauses and effects\n[edit]In a trust network, triadic closure is likely to develop due to the transitive property. If a node A trusts node B, and node B trusts node C, node A will have the basis to trust node C. In a social network, strong triadic closure occurs because there is increased opportunity for nodes A and C with common neighbor B to meet and therefore create at least weak ties. Node B also has the incentive to bring A and C together to decrease the latent stress in two separate relationships.[3]\nNetworks that stay true to this principle become highly interconnected and have very high clustering coefficients. However, networks that do not follow this principle turn out to be poorly connected and may suffer from instability once negative relations are included.\nTriadic closure is a good model for how networks will evolve over time. While simple graph theory tends to analyze networks at one point in time, applying the triadic closure principle can predict the development of ties within a network and show the progression of connectivity.[3]\nIn social networks, triadic closure facilitates cooperative behavior, but when new connections are made via referrals from existing connections the average global fraction of cooperators is less than when individuals choose new connections randomly from the population at large. Two possible effects of these are by the structural and informational construction. The structural construction arises from the propensity toward high clusterability. The informational construction comes from the assumption that an individual knows something about a friend's friend, as opposed to a random stranger.\nStrong Triadic Closure Property and local bridges\n[edit]A node A with strong ties to two neighbors B and C obeys the Strong Triadic Closure Property if these neighbors have an edge (either a weak or strong tie) between them.[3]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Georg Simmel Archived 2021-10-07 at the Wayback Machine, originator of the concept: \"Facebook\" article at the New York Times website.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily", "title": "Homophily - Wikipedia", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "text": "Homophily\n| Part of a series on | ||||\n| Network science | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Network types | ||||\n| Graphs | ||||\n|\n||||\n| Models | ||||\n|\n||||\n| ||||\nHomophily (from Ancient Greek ὁμός (homós) 'same, common' and φιλία (philía) 'friendship, love') is a concept in sociology describing the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others, as in the proverb \"birds of a feather flock together\".[1] The presence of homophily has been discovered in a vast array of network studies: over 100 studies have observed homophily in some form or another, and they establish that similarity is associated with connection.[2] The categories on which homophily occurs include age, gender, class, and organizational role.[3]\nThe opposite of homophily is heterophily or intermingling.[4] Individuals in homophilic relationships share common characteristics (beliefs, values, education, etc.) that make communication and relationship formation easier. Homophily between mated pairs in animals has been extensively studied in the field of evolutionary biology, where it is known as assortative mating. Homophily between mated pairs is common within natural animal mating populations.[5]\nHomophily has a variety of consequences for social and economic outcomes.[6]\nTypes and dimensions\n[edit]Baseline vs. inbreeding\n[edit]To test the relevance of homophily, researchers have distinguished between two types:[2]\n- Baseline homophily: simply the amount of homophily that would be expected by chance given an existing uneven distribution of people with varying characteristics; and\n- Inbreeding homophily: the amount of homophily over and above this expected value, typically due to personal preferences and choices.[7]\nStatus vs. value\n[edit]In their original formulation of homophily, Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton (1954) distinguished between status homophily and value homophily; individuals with similar social status characteristics were more likely to associate with each other than by chance:[8][2]\n- Status homophily: includes both society-ascribed characteristics (e.g. race, ethnicity, sex, and age) and acquired characteristics (e.g., religion, occupation, behavior patterns, and education).[9]\n- Value homophily: involves association with others who have similar values, attitudes, and beliefs, regardless of differences in status characteristics.[9]\nDimensions\n[edit]Race and ethnicity\n[edit]Social networks in the United States today are strongly divided by race and ethnicity,[10] which account for a large proportion of inbreeding homophily (though classification by these criteria can be problematic in sociology due to fuzzy boundaries and different definitions of race[11]).\nSmaller groups have lower diversity simply due to the number of members. This tends to give racial and ethnic minority groups a higher baseline homophily. Race and ethnicity also correlates with educational attainment and occupation, which further increase baseline homophily.[2]\nSex and gender\n[edit]In terms of sex and gender, the baseline homophily networks were relatively low compared to race and ethnicity. In this form of homophily men and women frequently live together and have large populations that are normally equal in size. It is also common to find higher levels of gender homophily among school students.[12] Most sex homophily are a result of inbreeding homophily.[2]\nAge\n[edit]Most age homophily is of the baseline type. An interesting pattern of inbreeding age homophily for groups of different ages was found by Marsden (1988).[13] It indicated a strong relationship between someone's age and the social distance to other people with regard to confiding in someone. For example, the larger age gap someone had, the smaller chances that they were confided in by others with lower ages to \"discuss important matters.\"[2]\nReligion\n[edit]Homophily based on religion is due to both baseline and inbreeding homophily. Those that belong in the same religion are more likely to exhibit acts of service and aid to one another, such as loaning money, giving therapeutic counseling, and other forms of help during moments of emergency. Parents have been shown to have higher levels of religious homophily than nonparent, which supports the notion that religious institutions are sought out for the benefit of children.[2]\nEducation, occupation and social class\n[edit]Family of birth accounts for considerable baseline homophily with respect to education, occupation, and social class. In terms of education, there is a divide among those who have a college education and those who do not. Another major distinction can be seen between those with white collar occupations and those with blue collar occupations.[2]\nInterests\n[edit]Homophily occurs within groups of people that have similar interests as well. We enjoy interacting more with individuals who share similarities with us, so we tend to actively seek out these connections.[14] Additionally, as more users begin to rely on the Internet to find like-minded communities for themselves, many examples of niches within social media sites have begun appearing to account for this need. This response has led to the popularity of sites like Reddit in the 2010s, advertising itself as a \"home to thousands of communities... and authentic human interaction\".[15]\nSocial media\n[edit]As social networks are largely divided by race, social-networking websites like Facebook also foster homophilic atmospheres.[16] When a Facebook user 'likes' or interacts with an article or post of a certain ideology, Facebook continues to show that user posts of that similar ideology (which Facebook believes they will be drawn to). In a research article, McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook (2003) write that homogeneous personal networks result in limited \"social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience.\"[17] This homophily can foster divides and echo chambers on social networking sites, where people of similar ideologies only interact with each other.\nCauses and effects\n[edit]Causes\n[edit]Geography: Baseline homophily often arises when the people who are located nearby also have similar characteristics.[18] People are more likely to have contact with those who are geographically closer than those who are distant. Technology such as the telephone, e-mail, and social networks have reduced but not eliminated this effect.\nFamily ties: These ties decay slowly, but familial ties, specifically that of domestic partners, fulfill many requisites that generate homophily. Family relationships are generally close and keep frequent contact though they may be at great geographic distances. Ideas that may get lost in other relational contexts, will often instead lead to actions in this setting.[19]\nOrganizations: School, work, and volunteer activities provide the great majority of non-family ties. Many friendships, confiding relations, and social support ties are formed within voluntary groups. The social homogeneity of most organizations creates a strong baseline homophily in networks that are formed there.[20]\nIsomorphic sources: The connections between people who occupy equivalent roles will induce homophily in the system of network ties. This is common in three domains: workplace (e.g., all heads of HR departments will tend to associate with other HR heads), family (e.g., mothers tend to associate with other mothers), and informal networks.\nCognitive processes: People who have demographic similarity tend to own shared knowledge, and therefore they have a greater ease of communication and share cultural tastes, which can also generate homophily.\nEffects\n[edit]According to one study, perception of interpersonal similarity improves coordination and increase the expected payoff of interactions, above and beyond the effect of merely \"liking others.\"[21] Another study claims that homophily produces tolerance and cooperation in social spaces.[22] However, homophilic patterns can also restrict access to information or inclusion for minorities.[23]\nNowadays, the restrictive patterns of homophily can be widely seen within social media. This selectiveness within social media networks can be traced back to the origins of Facebook and the transition of users from MySpace to Facebook in the early 2000s.[24] One study of this shift in a network's user base from danah boyd (2011) found that this perception of homophily impacted many individuals' preference of one site over another.[25] Most users chose to be more active on the site their friends were on. However, along with the complexities of belongingness, people of similar ages, economic class, and prospective futures (higher education and/or career plans) shared similar reasons for favoring one social media platform. The different features of homophily affected their outlook of each respective site.\nThe effects of homophily on the diffusion of information and behaviors are also complex. Some studies have claimed that homophily facilitates access information,[26] the diffusion of innovations and behaviors,[27] and the formation of social norms.[28] Other studies, however, highlight mechanisms through which homophily can maintain disagreement, exacerbate polarization of opinions, lead to self segregation between groups, and slow the formation of an overall consensus.[29][30]\nAs online users have a degree of power to form and dictate the environment, the effects of homophily continue to persist. On Twitter, terms such as \"stan Twitter\", \"Black Twitter\", or \"local Twitter\"[31] have also been created and popularized by users to separate themselves based on specific dimensions.\nHomophily is a cause of homogamy—marriage between people with similar characteristics.[32] Homophily is a fertility factor; an increased fertility is seen in people with a tendency to seek acquaintance among those with common characteristics.[33] Governmental family policies have a decreased influence on fertility rates in such populations.[33]\nHeterophilic Graph Learning\n[edit]In graph representation learning, homophily means that nodes with the same label or attributes are more likely to be connected in the network. It is considered the most important reason for the success of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, it is recently found that there exists a non-trivial sets of dataset where homophily principle doesn't hold, i.e. heterophily, and GNN performance is unsatisfactory. Lots of efforts have been devoted to study heterophilic graph learning.[34][35][36]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Ferguson, Niall (15 August 2017). \"The False Prophecy of Hyperconnection\".

For example, that every equivalence relation is symmetric, but not necessarily antisymmetric, is indicated by in the \"Symmetric\" column and ✗ in the \"Antisymmetric\" column, respectively. All definitions tacitly require the homogeneous relation be transitive: for all if and then |\nA homogeneous relation R on the set X is a transitive relation if,[1]\n- for all a, b, c ∈ X, if a R b and b R c, then a R c.\nOr in terms of first-order logic:\n- ,\nwhere a R b is the infix notation for (a, b) ∈ R.\nExamples\n[edit]As a non-mathematical example, the relation \"is an ancestor of\" is transitive. For example, if Amy is an ancestor of Becky, and Becky is an ancestor of Carrie, then Amy is also an ancestor of Carrie.\nOn the other hand, \"is the birth mother of\" is not a transitive relation, because if Alice is the birth mother of Brenda, and Brenda is the birth mother of Claire, then it does not follow that Alice is the birth mother of Claire. In fact, this relation is antitransitive: Alice can never be the birth mother of Claire.\nNon-transitive, non-antitransitive relations include sports fixtures (playoff schedules), 'knows' and 'talks to'.\nThe examples \"is greater than\", \"is at least as great as\", and \"is equal to\" (equality) are transitive relations on various sets. As are the set of real numbers or the set of natural numbers:\n- whenever x > y and y > z, then also x > z\n- whenever x ≥ y and y ≥ z, then also x ≥ z\n- whenever x = y and y = z, then also x = z.\nMore examples of transitive relations:\n- \"is a subset of\" (set inclusion, a relation on sets)\n- \"divides\" (divisibility, a relation on natural numbers)\n- \"implies\" (implication, symbolized by \"⇒\", a relation on propositions)\nExamples of non-transitive relations:\n- \"is the successor of\" (a relation on natural numbers)\n- \"is a member of the set\" (symbolized as \"∈\")[2]\n- \"is perpendicular to\" (a relation on lines in Euclidean geometry)\nThe empty relation on any set is transitive[3] because there are no elements such that and , and hence the transitivity condition is vacuously true. A relation R containing only one ordered pair is also transitive: if the ordered pair is of the form for some the only such elements are , and indeed in this case , while if the ordered pair is not of the form then there are no such elements and hence is vacuously transitive.\nVacuous transitivity is transitivity when in a relation there are no ordered pairs of the form (a,b) and (b,c).\nProperties\n[edit]Closure properties\n[edit]- The converse (inverse) of a transitive relation is always transitive. For instance, knowing that \"is a subset of\" is transitive and \"is a superset of\" is its converse, one can conclude that the latter is transitive as well.\n- The intersection of two transitive relations is always transitive.[4] For instance, knowing that \"was born before\" and \"has the same first name as\" are transitive, one can conclude that \"was born before and also has the same first name as\" is also transitive.\n- The union of two transitive relations need not be transitive. For instance, \"was born before or has the same first name as\" is not a transitive relation, since e.g. Herbert Hoover is related to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is in turn related to Franklin Pierce, while Hoover is not related to Franklin Pierce.\n- The complement of a transitive relation need not be transitive.[5] For instance, while \"equal to\" is transitive, \"not equal to\" is only transitive on sets with at most one element.\nOther properties\n[edit]A transitive relation is asymmetric if and only if it is irreflexive.[6]\nA transitive relation need not be reflexive. When it is, it is called a preorder. For example, on set X = {1,2,3}:\n- R = { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3), (3,2) } is reflexive, but not transitive, as the pair (1,2) is absent,\n- R = { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3) } is reflexive as well as transitive, so it is a preorder,\n- R = { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) } is reflexive as well as transitive, another preorder,\n- R = { (1,2), (2,3), (1,3) } is transitive, but not reflexive.\nAs a counter example, the relation on the real numbers is transitive, but not reflexive.\nTransitive extensions and transitive closure\n[edit]Let R be a binary relation on set X. The transitive extension of R, denoted R1, is the smallest binary relation on X such that R1 contains R, and if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R then (a, c) ∈ R1.[7] For example, suppose X is a set of towns, some of which are connected by roads. Let R be the relation on towns where (A, B) ∈ R if there is a road directly linking town A and town B. This relation need not be transitive. The transitive extension of this relation can be defined by (A, C) ∈ R1 if you can travel between towns A and C by using at most two roads.\nIf a relation is transitive then its transitive extension is itself, that is, if R is a transitive relation then R1 = R.\nThe transitive extension of R1 would be denoted by R2, and continuing in this way, in general, the transitive extension of Ri would be Ri + 1. The transitive closure of R, denoted by R* or R∞ is the set union of R, R1, R2, ... .[8]\nThe transitive closure of a relation is a transitive relation.[8]\nThe relation \"is the birth parent of\" on a set of people is not a transitive relation. However, in biology the need often arises to consider birth parenthood over an arbitrary number of generations: the relation \"is a birth ancestor of\" is a transitive relation and it is the transitive closure of the relation \"is the birth parent of\".\nFor the example of towns and roads above, (A, C) ∈ R* provided you can travel between towns A and C using any number of roads.\nRelation types that require transitivity\n[edit]- Preorder – a reflexive and transitive relation\n- Partial order – an antisymmetric preorder\n- Total preorder – a connected (formerly called total) preorder\n- Equivalence relation – a symmetric preorder\n- Strict weak ordering – a strict partial order in which incomparability is an equivalence relation\n- Total ordering – a connected (total), antisymmetric, and transitive relation\nCounting transitive relations\n[edit]No general formula that counts the number of transitive relations on a finite set (sequence A006905 in the OEIS) is known.[9] However, there is a formula for finding the number of relations that are simultaneously reflexive, symmetric, and transitive – in other words, equivalence relations – (sequence A000110 in the OEIS), those that are symmetric and transitive, those that are symmetric, transitive, and antisymmetric, and those that are total, transitive, and antisymmetric. Pfeiffer[10] has made some progress in this direction, expressing relations with combinations of these properties in terms of each other, but still calculating any one is difficult. See also Brinkmann and McKay (2005)[11] and Mala (2022).[12]\nSince the reflexivization of any transitive relation is a preorder, the number of transitive relations an on n-element set is at most 2n time more than the number of preorders, thus it is asymptotically by results of Kleitman and Rothschild.[13]\n| Elements | Any | Transitive | Reflexive | Symmetric | Preorder | Partial order | Total preorder | Total order | Equivalence relation |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 2 | 16 | 13 | 4 | 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 |\n| 3 | 512 | 171 | 64 | 64 | 29 | 19 | 13 | 6 | 5 |\n| 4 | 65,536 | 3,994 | 4,096 | 1,024 | 355 | 219 | 75 | 24 | 15 |\n| n | 2n2 | 2n(n−1) | 2n(n+1)/2 | ∑n k=0 k!S(n, k) |\nn! | ∑n k=0 S(n, k) | |||\n| OEIS | A002416 | A006905 | A053763 | A006125 | A000798 | A001035 | A000670 | A000142 | A000110 |\nNote that S(n, k) refers to Stirling numbers of the second kind.\nRelated properties\n[edit]A relation R is called intransitive if it is not transitive, that is, if xRy and yRz, but not xRz, for some x, y, z. In contrast, a relation R is called antitransitive if xRy and yRz always implies that xRz does not hold. For example, the relation defined by xRy if xy is an even number is intransitive,[14] but not antitransitive.[15] The relation defined by xRy if x is even and y is odd is both transitive and antitransitive.[16] The relation defined by xRy if x is the successor number of y is both intransitive[17] and antitransitive.[18] Unexpected examples of intransitivity arise in situations such as political questions or group preferences.[19]\nGeneralized to stochastic versions (stochastic transitivity), the study of transitivity finds applications of in decision theory, psychometrics and utility models.[20]\nA quasitransitive relation is another generalization;[5] it is required to be transitive only on its non-symmetric part. Such relations are used in social choice theory or microeconomics.[21]\nProposition: If R is a univalent, then R;RT is transitive.\n- proof: Suppose Then there are a and b such that Since R is univalent, yRb and aRTy imply a=b. Therefore xRaRTz, hence xR;RTz and R;RT is transitive.\nCorollary: If R is univalent, then R;RT is an equivalence relation on the domain of R.\n- proof: R;RT is symmetric and reflexive on its domain. With univalence of R, the transitive requirement for equivalence is fulfilled.\nSee also\n[edit]- Transitive reduction\n- Intransitive dice\n- Rational choice theory\n- Hypothetical syllogism — transitivity of the material conditional\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ Smith, Eggen & St. Andre 2006, p. 145\n- ^ However, the class of von Neumann ordinals is constructed in a way such that ∈ is transitive when restricted to that class.\n- ^ Smith, Eggen & St. Andre 2006, p. 146\n- ^ Bianchi, Mariagrazia; Mauri, Anna Gillio Berta; Herzog, Marcel; Verardi, Libero (2000-01-12), \"On finite solvable groups in which normality is a transitive relation\", Journal of Group Theory, 3 (2), doi:10.1515/jgth.2000.012, ISSN 1433-5883, archived from the original on 2023-02-04, retrieved 2022-12-29\n- ^ a b Robinson, Derek J.

They are also referred to under the names Yule process, cumulative advantage, the rich get richer, and the Matthew effect.[1] They are also related to Gibrat's law.\nThe principal reason for scientific interest in preferential attachment is that it can, under suitable circumstances, generate power law distributions.[2] If preferential attachment is non-linear, measured distributions may deviate from a power law.[3] These mechanisms may generate distributions which are approximately power law over transient periods.[4][5]\nDefinition\n[edit]A preferential attachment process is a stochastic urn process, meaning a process in which discrete units of wealth, usually called \"balls\", are added in a random or partly random fashion to a set of objects or containers, usually called \"urns\". A preferential attachment process is an urn process in which additional balls are added continuously to the system and are distributed among the urns as an increasing function of the number of balls the urns already have. In the most commonly studied examples, the number of urns also increases continuously, although this is not a necessary condition for preferential attachment and examples have been studied with constant or even decreasing numbers of urns.\nA classic example of a preferential attachment process is the growth in the number of species per genus in some higher taxon of biotic organisms.[6] New genera (\"urns\") are added to a taxon whenever a newly appearing species is considered sufficiently different from its predecessors that it does not belong in any of the current genera. New species (\"balls\") are added as old ones speciate (i.e., split in two) and, assuming that new species belong to the same genus as their parent (except for those that start new genera), the probability that a new species is added to a genus will be proportional to the number of species the genus already has. This process, first studied by British statistician Udny Yule, is a linear preferential attachment process, since the rate at which genera accrue new species is linear in the number they already have.\nLinear preferential attachment processes in which the number of urns increases are known to produce a distribution of balls over the urns following the so-called Yule distribution. In the most general form of the process, balls are added to the system at an overall rate of m new balls for each new urn. Each newly created urn starts out with k0 balls and further balls are added to urns at a rate proportional to the number k that they already have plus a constant a > −k0. With these definitions, the fraction P(k) of urns having k balls in the limit of long time is given by[7]\nfor k ≥ k0 (and zero otherwise), where B(x, y) is the Euler beta function:\nwith Γ(x) being the standard gamma function, and\nThe beta function behaves asymptotically as B(x, y) ~ x−y for large x and fixed y, which implies that for large values of k we have\nIn other words, the preferential attachment process generates a \"long-tailed\" distribution following a Pareto distribution or power law in its tail. This is the primary reason for the historical interest in preferential attachment: the species distribution and many other phenomena are observed empirically to follow power laws and the preferential attachment process is a leading candidate mechanism to explain this behavior. Preferential attachment is considered a possible candidate for, among other things, the distribution of the sizes of cities,[8] the wealth of extremely wealthy individuals,[8] the number of citations received by learned publications,[9] and the number of links to pages on the World Wide Web.[2]\nThe general model described here includes many other specific models as special cases. In the species/genus example above, for instance, each genus starts out with a single species (k0 = 1) and gains new species in direct proportion to the number it already has (a = 0), and hence P(k) = B(k, γ)/B(k0, γ − 1) with γ=2 + 1/m. Similarly the Price model for scientific citations[9] corresponds to the case k0 = 0, a = 1 and the widely studied Barabási-Albert model[2] corresponds to k0 = m, a = 0.\nPreferential attachment is sometimes referred to as the Matthew effect, but the two are not precisely equivalent. The Matthew effect, first discussed by Robert K. Merton,[10] is named for a passage in the biblical Gospel of Matthew: \"For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.\" (Matthew 25:29, New International Version.) The preferential attachment process does not incorporate the taking away part. This point may be moot, however, since the scientific insight behind the Matthew effect is in any case entirely different. Qualitatively it is intended to describe not a mechanical multiplicative effect like preferential attachment but a specific human behavior in which people are more likely to give credit to the famous than to the little known. The classic example of the Matthew effect is a scientific discovery made simultaneously by two different people, one well known and the other little known. It is claimed that under these circumstances people tend more often to credit the discovery to the well-known scientist. Thus the real-world phenomenon the Matthew effect is intended to describe is quite distinct from (though certainly related to) preferential attachment.\nHistory\n[edit]The first rigorous consideration of preferential attachment seems to be that of Udny Yule in 1925, who used it to explain the power-law distribution of the number of species per genus of flowering plants.[6] The process is sometimes called a \"Yule process\" in his honor. Yule was able to show that the process gave rise to a distribution with a power-law tail, but the details of his proof are, by today's standards, contorted and difficult, since the modern tools of stochastic process theory did not yet exist and he was forced to use more cumbersome methods of proof.\nMost modern treatments of preferential attachment make use of the master equation method, whose use in this context was pioneered by Simon in 1955, in work on the distribution of sizes of cities and other phenomena.[8]\nThe first application of preferential attachment to learned citations was given by Price in 1976.[9] (He referred to the process as a \"cumulative advantage\" process.) His was also the first application of the process to the growth of a network, producing what would now be called a scale-free network. It is in the context of network growth that the process is most frequently studied today. Price also promoted preferential attachment as a possible explanation for power laws in many other phenomena, including Lotka's law of scientific productivity and Bradford's law of journal use.\nThe application of preferential attachment to the growth of the World Wide Web was proposed by Barabási and Albert in 1999.[2] Barabási and Albert also coined the name \"preferential attachment\" by which the process is best known today[11] and suggested that the process might apply to the growth of other networks as well. For growing networks, the precise functional form of preferential attachment can be estimated by maximum likelihood estimation.[12]\nSee also\n[edit]- Assortative mixing\n- Bose–Einstein condensation: a network theory approach\n- Capital accumulation\n- Chinese restaurant process\n- Complex network\n- Double jeopardy (marketing)\n- Lindy effect\n- Link-centric preferential attachment\n- Pitman–Yor process\n- Price's model\n- Proof of stake\n- Simon model\n- Success to the successful\n- Wealth condensation\n- Yule–Simon distribution\n- Bibliogram\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Zinilli, Antonio (30 April 2025).

It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).\n\"Hypertext\" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.\nHTML uses \"markup\" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special \"elements\" such as <head>\n, <title>\n, <body>\n, <header>\n, <footer>\n, <article>\n, <section>\n, <p>\n, <div>\n, <span>\n, <img>\n, <aside>\n, <audio>\n, <canvas>\n, <datalist>\n, <details>\n, <embed>\n, <nav>\n, <search>\n, <output>\n, <progress>\n, <video>\n, <ul>\n, <ol>\n, <li>\nand many others.\nAn HTML element is set off from other text in a document by \"tags\", which consist of the element name surrounded by <\nand >\n. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title>\ntag can be written as <Title>\n, <TITLE>\n, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.\nThe articles below can help you learn more about HTML.\nBeginner's tutorials\nOur learn web development core modules contain modern, up-to-date tutorials covering HTML fundamentals.\n- Your first website: Creating the content\n-\nThis article provides a brief tour of what HTML is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.\n- Structuring content with HTML\n-\nThis module covers the basics of the HTML language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.\n- HTML forms\n-\nForms are a very important part of the Web â these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g., registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.\nGuides\nThe HTML guides help you build with HTML on the web. They cover topics such as forms, CORS, content preloading, and responsive images.\n- HTML cheatsheet for syntax and common tasks\n-\nQuick reference for common HTML syntax and tasks.\n- Using HTML comments\n<!-- â¦ -->\n-\nHTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.\n- Using HTML form validation and the Constraint Validation API\n-\nHTML5 introduced constraint validation to ease form validation on the client side. Basic constraints can be checked without JavaScript by setting attributes on form elements.\n- Content categories\n-\nHTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.\n- Using date and time formats in HTML\n-\nCertain HTML elements use date and/or time values. This guide describes the formats of the strings that specify these values.\n- Using microdata in HTML\n-\nMicrodata is used to nest metadata within existing content on web pages. Search engines and web crawlers can extract and process microdata to provide a richer browsing experience.\n- Using microformats in HTML\n-\nMicroformats are standards used to embed semantics and structured data in HTML for use by social web applications, search engines, aggregators, and other tools.\n- Understanding quirks and standards modes\n-\nHistorical information on quirks mode and standards mode.\n- Using responsive images in HTML\n-\nLearn about responsive images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other features, improving performance across different devices.\n- Media types and formats on the web\n-\nThe\n<audio>\nand<video>\nelements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support.\nHow to\n- Define terms with HTML\n-\nHTML provides several ways to convey description semantics, whether inline or as structured glossaries. This article shows how to properly mark up keywords when defining them.\n- Use data attributes\n-\nHTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning.\ndata-*\nattributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements. - Use cross-origin images in a canvas\n-\nSome HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as\n<img>\nor<video>\n, have acrossorigin\nattribute (crossOrigin\nproperty), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. - Add a hitmap on top of an image\n-\nImage maps allow hyperlinks to be associated with different parts of an image. This article shows how to create and implement them.\n-\nThese tips are based on common knowledge and experimentation. An optimized web page not only provides for a more responsive site for your visitors but also reduces the load on your web servers and internet connection.\n- Add JavaScript to your web page\n-\nThis article explains how to add JavaScript code to an HTML file.\nReference\nHTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links. Browse the complete HTML reference documentation.\n- HTML elements\n-\nReference for all HTML elements.\n- HTML attributes\n-\nReference for all HTML attributes. Attributes are additional values that configure elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.\n- Global attributes\n-\nReference for global attributes that may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.\nAttributes by element\n- Input types\n-\nUsed to create interactive controls for web-based forms.\n- Script types\n-\nIndicates the type of script represented by the element.\n- meta name\n-\nProvides metadata in name-value pairs for the whole page.\nAttribute values\n- rel keywords\n-\nDefines the relationship between a linked resource and the current document.\nRelated topics\n- Applying color to HTML elements using CSS\n-\nThis article covers most of the ways you use CSS to add color to HTML content, listing what parts of HTML documents can be colored and what CSS properties to use when doing so."}

An alphabetical list of all elements is provided in the sidebar on every element's page as well as this one.\nNote: For more information about the basics of HTML elements and attributes, see Anatomy of an HTML element.\nMain root\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<html> |\nRepresents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element. |\nDocument metadata\nMetadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or linked to another file that has the information.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<base> |\nSpecifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one such element in a document. |\n<head> |\nContains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. |\n<link> |\nSpecifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both \"favicon\" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things. |\n<meta> |\nRepresents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base> , <link> , <script> , <style> and <title> . |\n<style> |\nContains style information for a document or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing this element. |\n<title> |\nDefines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; HTML tags within the element, if any, are also treated as plain text. |\nSectioning root\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<body> |\nRepresents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document. |\nContent sectioning\nContent sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<address> |\nIndicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization. |\n<article> |\nRepresents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. |\n<aside> |\nRepresents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes. |\n<footer> |\nRepresents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data, or links to related documents. |\n<header> |\nRepresents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements. |\n<h1> , <h2> , <h3> , <h4> , <h5> , <h6> |\nRepresent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest. |\n<hgroup> |\nRepresents a heading grouped with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or a tagline. |\n<main> |\nRepresents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application. |\n<nav> |\nRepresents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes. |\n<section> |\nRepresents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions. |\n<search> |\nRepresents a part that contains a set of form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation. |\nText content\nUse HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening <body>\nand closing </body>\ntags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<blockquote> |\nIndicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element. |\n<dd> |\nProvides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (<dt> ) in a description list (<dl> ). |\n<div> |\nThe generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like flexbox is applied to its parent element). |\n<dl> |\nRepresents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs). |\n<dt> |\nSpecifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd> element. |\n<figcaption> |\nRepresents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent <figure> element. |\n<figure> |\nRepresents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit. |\n<hr> |\nRepresents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section. |\n<li> |\nRepresents an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol> ), an unordered list (<ul> ), or a menu (<menu> ). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter. |\n<menu> |\nA semantic alternative to <ul> , but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than <ul> . It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by <li> elements). |\n<ol> |\nRepresents an ordered list of items â typically rendered as a numbered list. |\n<p> |\nRepresents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields. |\n<pre> |\nRepresents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced, font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written. |\n<ul> |\nRepresents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list. |\nInline text semantics\nUse the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<a> |\nTogether with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address. |\n<abbr> |\nRepresents an abbreviation or acronym. |\n<b> |\nUsed to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <strong> element. |\n<bdi> |\nTells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted. |\n<bdo> |\nOverrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction. |\n<br> |\nProduces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant. |\n<cite> |\nUsed to mark up the title of a creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata. |\n<code> |\nDisplays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font. |\n<data> |\nLinks a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the <time> element must be used. |\n<dfn> |\nUsed to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The ancestor <p> element, the <dt> /<dd> pairing, or the nearest section ancestor of the <dfn> element, is considered to be the definition of the term. |\n<em> |\nMarks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis. |\n<i> |\nRepresents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element. |\n<kbd> |\nRepresents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard. |\n<mark> |\nRepresents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context. |\n<q> |\nIndicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <blockquote> element. |\n<rp> |\nUsed to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element. One <rp> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <rt> element that contains the annotation's text. |\n<rt> |\nSpecifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element must always be contained within a <ruby> element. |\n<ruby> |\nRepresents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common. |\n<s> |\nRenders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate. |\n<samp> |\nUsed to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console). |\n<small> |\nRepresents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font size smaller, such as from small to x-small . |\n<span> |\nA generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang . It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element. |\n<strong> |\nIndicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type. |\n<sub> |\nSpecifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text. |\n<sup> |\nSpecifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text. |\n<time> |\nRepresents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders. |\n<u> |\nRepresents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a single solid underline but may be altered using CSS. |\n<var> |\nRepresents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent. |\n<wbr> |\nRepresents a word break opportunityâa position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location. |\nImage and multimedia\nHTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<area> |\nDefines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with hyperlink. |\n<audio> |\nUsed to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream . |\n<img> |\nEmbeds an image into the document. |\n<map> |\nUsed with <area> elements to define an image map (a clickable link area). |\n<track> |\nUsed as a child of the media elements, audio and video. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files)âWeb Video Text Tracks. |\n<video> |\nEmbeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use <video> for audio content, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience. |\nEmbedded content\nIn addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<embed> |\nEmbeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in. |\n<fencedframe> |\nRepresents a nested browsing context, like <iframe> but with more native privacy features built in. |\n<iframe> |\nRepresents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one. |\n<object> |\nRepresents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin. |\n<picture> |\nContains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios. |\n<source> |\nSpecifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats. |\nSVG and MathML\nYou can embed SVG and MathML content directly into HTML documents, using the <svg>\nand <math>\nelements.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<svg> |\nContainer defining a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document. |\n<math> |\nThe top-level element in MathML. Every valid MathML instance must be wrapped in it. In addition, you must not nest a second <math> element in another, but you can have an arbitrary number of other child elements in it. |\nScripting\nTo create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<canvas> |\nContainer element to use with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations. |\n<noscript> |\nDefines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser. |\n<script> |\nUsed to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The <script> element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON. |\nDemarcating edits\nThese elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the text have been altered.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<del> |\nRepresents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering \"track changes\" or source code diff information, for example. The <ins> element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document. |\n<ins> |\nRepresents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the <del> element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document. |\nTable content\nThe elements here are used to create and handle tabular data.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<caption> |\nSpecifies the caption (or title) of a table. |\n<col> |\nDefines one or more columns in a column group represented by its implicit or explicit parent <colgroup> element. The <col> element is only valid as a child of a <colgroup> element that has no span attribute defined. |\n<colgroup> |\nDefines a group of columns within a table. |\n<table> |\nRepresents tabular dataâthat is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data. |\n<tbody> |\nEncapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the body of a table's (main) data. |\n<td> |\nA child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell of a table that contains data. |\n<tfoot> |\nEncapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the foot of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the columns, e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column. |\n<th> |\nA child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell as the header of a group of table cells. The nature of this group can be explicitly defined by the scope and headers attributes. |\n<thead> |\nEncapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the head of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually in the form of column headers (<th> elements). |\n<tr> |\nDefines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of <td> (data cell) and <th> (header cell) elements. |\nForms\nHTML provides several elements that can be used together to create forms that the user can fill out and submit to the website or application. Further information about this available in the HTML forms guide.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<button> |\nAn interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog. |\n<datalist> |\nContains a set of <option> elements that represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls. |\n<fieldset> |\nUsed to group several controls as well as labels (<label> ) within a web form. |\n<form> |\nRepresents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information. |\n<input> |\nUsed to create interactive controls for web-based forms to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The <input> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes. |\n<label> |\nRepresents a caption for an item in a user interface. |\n<legend> |\nRepresents a caption for the content of its parent <fieldset> . |\n<meter> |\nRepresents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value. |\n<optgroup> |\nCreates a grouping of options within a <select> element. |\n<option> |\nUsed to define an item contained in a <select> , an <optgroup> , or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document. |\n<output> |\nContainer element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action. |\n<progress> |\nDisplays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar. |\n<select> |\nRepresents a control that provides a menu of options. |\n<selectedcontent> |\nDisplays the content of the currently selected <option> inside a closed <select> element. |\n<textarea> |\nRepresents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example, a comment on a review or feedback form. |\nInteractive elements\nHTML offers a selection of elements that help to create interactive user interface objects.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<details> |\nCreates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an \"open\" state. A summary or label must be provided using the <summary> element. |\n<dialog> |\nRepresents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow. |\n<summary> |\nSpecifies a summary, caption, or legend for a details element's disclosure box. Clicking the <summary> element toggles the state of the parent <details> element open and closed. |\nWeb Components\nWeb Components is an HTML-related technology that makes it possible to, essentially, create and use custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In addition, you can create custom versions of standard HTML elements.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<slot> |\nPart of the Web Components technology suite, this element is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together. |\n<template> |\nA mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript. |\nObsolete and deprecated elements\nWarning: These are old HTML elements that are deprecated and should not be used. You should never use them in new projects, and you should replace them in old projects as soon as you can. They are listed here for completeness only.\n| Element | Description |\n|---|---|\n<acronym> |\nAllows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word. |\n<big> |\nRenders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium becomes large , for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size. |\n<center> |\nDisplays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element. |\n<content> |\nAn obsolete part of the Web Components suite of technologiesâwas used inside of Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary HTML. It has now been replaced by the <slot> element, which creates a point in the DOM at which a shadow DOM can be inserted. Consider using <slot> instead. |\n<dir> |\nContainer for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the <ul> element for lists, including lists of files. |\n<font> |\nDefines the font size, color and face for its content. |\n<frame> |\nDefines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset> . |\n<frameset> |\nUsed to contain <frame> elements. |\n<image> |\nAn ancient and poorly supported precursor to the <img> element. It should not be used. |\n<marquee> |\nUsed to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes. |\n<menuitem> |\nRepresents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button. |\n<nobr> |\nPrevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text. |\n<noembed> |\nAn obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or \"fallback\", content for browsers that do not support the embed element or do not support the type of embedded content an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an <object> element. |\n<noframes> |\nProvides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the <frame> element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers. |\n<param> |\nDefines parameters for an <object> element. |\n<plaintext> |\nRenders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text. |\n<rb> |\nUsed to delimit the base text component of a ruby annotation, i.e., the text that is being annotated. One <rb> element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text. |\n<rtc> |\nEmbraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of <rb> elements used inside of <ruby> element. <rb> elements can have both pronunciation (<rt> ) and semantic (<rtc> ) annotations. |\n<shadow> |\nAn obsolete part of the Web Components technology suite that was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. Consider using <slot> instead. |\n<strike> |\nPlaces a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text. |\n<tt> |\nCreates inline text which is presented using the user agent default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer. |\n<xmp> |\nRenders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line. |\nSee also\nElement\ninterface"}
{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes", "title": "Global attributes - HTML | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Global attributes\nGlobal attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements.\nGlobal attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. That means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant. For example, HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as <foo hidden>â¦</foo>\n, even though <foo>\nis not a valid HTML element.\nIn addition to the basic HTML global attributes, the following global attributes also exist:\nxml:lang\nandxml:base\nâ these are inherited from the XHTML specifications and deprecated, but kept for compatibility purposes.- The ARIA\nrole\nattribute and the multiplearia-*\nstates and properties, used for ensuring accessibility. - The event handler attributes listed below.\nList of global attributes\naccesskey\n-\nProvides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element. This attribute consists of a space-separated list of characters. The browser should use the first one that exists on the computer keyboard layout.\nanchor\nNon-standard-\nAssociates a positioned element with an anchor element. The attribute's value is the\nid\nvalue of the element you want to anchor the positioned element to. The element can then be positioned using CSS anchor positioning. autocapitalize\n-\nControls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so, in what manner.\nautocorrect\n-\nControls whether input text is automatically corrected for spelling errors. This can be applied to elements that have editable text except for\n<input>\nelements with the attribute:type=\"password\"\n,type=\"email\"\n, ortype=\"url\"\n. autofocus\n-\nIndicates that an element is to be focused on page load, or as soon as the\n<dialog>\nit is part of is displayed. This attribute is a boolean, initially false. class\n-\nA space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the method\nDocument.getElementsByClassName()\n. contenteditable\n-\nAn enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be editable by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow editing. The attribute must take one of the following values:\ntrue\nor the empty string, which indicates that the element must be editable;false\n, which indicates that the element must not be editable.plaintext-only\n, which indicates the element's raw text is editable, but rich text formatting is disabled.\ndata-*\n-\nForms a class of attributes, called custom data attributes, that allow proprietary information to be exchanged between the HTML and its DOM representation that may be used by scripts. All such custom data are available via the\nHTMLElement\ninterface of the element the attribute is set on. TheHTMLElement.dataset\nproperty gives access to them. dir\n-\nAn enumerated attribute indicating the directionality of the element's text. It can have the following values:\nltr\n, which means left to right and is to be used for languages that are written from the left to the right (like English);rtl\n, which means right to left and is to be used for languages that are written from the right to the left (like Arabic);auto\n, which lets the user agent decide. It uses a basic algorithm as it parses the characters inside the element until it finds a character with a strong directionality, then it applies that directionality to the whole element.\ndraggable\n-\nAn enumerated attribute indicating whether the element can be dragged, using the Drag and Drop API. It can have the following values:\ntrue\n, which indicates that the element may be draggedfalse\n, which indicates that the element may not be dragged.\nenterkeyhint\n-\nHints what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.\nexportparts\n-\nUsed to transitively export shadow parts from a nested shadow tree into a containing light tree.\n-\nAn enumerated attribute indicating that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant. For example, it can be used to hide elements of the page that can't be used until the login process has been completed. The browser won't render such elements. This attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown.\nid\n-\nDefines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).\ninert\n-\nA boolean value that makes the browser disregard user input events for the element. Useful when click events are present.\ninputmode\n-\nProvides a hint to browsers about the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Used primarily on\n<input>\nelements, but is usable on any element while incontenteditable\nmode. is\n-\nAllows you to specify that a standard HTML element should behave like a registered customized built-in element (see Using custom elements for more details).\nNote:\nThe item*\nattributes are part of the WHATWG HTML Microdata feature.\nitemid\n-\nThe unique, global identifier of an item.\nitemprop\n-\nUsed to add properties to an item. Every HTML element may have an\nitemprop\nattribute specified, where anitemprop\nconsists of a name and value pair. itemref\n-\nProperties that are not descendants of an element with the\nitemscope\nattribute can be associated with the item using anitemref\n. It provides a list of element ids (notitemid\ns) with additional properties elsewhere in the document. itemscope\n-\nitemscope\n(usually) works along withitemtype\nto specify that the HTML contained in a block is about a particular item.itemscope\ncreates the Item and defines the scope of theitemtype\nassociated with it.itemtype\nis a valid URL of a vocabulary (such as schema.org) that describes the item and its properties context. itemtype\n-\nSpecifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define\nitemprop\ns (item properties) in the data structure.itemscope\nis used to set the scope of where in the data structure the vocabulary set byitemtype\nwill be active. lang\n-\nHelps define the language of an element: the language that non-editable elements are in, or the language that editable elements should be written in by the user. The attribute should contain a valid BCP 47 language tag.\nxml:lang\nhas priority over it. nonce\n-\nA cryptographic nonce (\"number used once\") which can be used by Content Security Policy to determine whether or not a given fetch will be allowed to proceed.\npart\n-\nA space-separated list of the part names of the element. Part names allows CSS to select and style specific elements in a shadow tree via the\n::part\npseudo-element. popover\n-\nUsed to designate an element as a popover element (see Popover API). Popover elements are hidden via\ndisplay: none\nuntil opened via an invoking/control element (i.e., a<button>\nor<input type=\"button\">\nwith apopovertarget\nattribute) or aHTMLElement.showPopover()\ncall. role\n-\nRoles define the semantic meaning of content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object.\nroles\nare added to HTML elements usingrole=\"role_type\"\n, whererole_type\nis the name of a role in the ARIA specification. slot\n-\nAssigns a slot in a shadow DOM shadow tree to an element: An element with a\nslot\nattribute is assigned to the slot created by the<slot>\nelement whosename\nattribute's value matches thatslot\nattribute's value. spellcheck\n-\nAn enumerated attribute defines whether the element may be checked for spelling errors. It may have the following values:\n- empty string or\ntrue\n, which indicates that the element should be, if possible, checked for spelling errors; false\n, which indicates that the element should not be checked for spelling errors.\n- empty string or\nstyle\n-\nContains CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file or files. This attribute and the\n<style>\nelement have mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling, for example for testing purposes. tabindex\n-\nAn integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation, and if so, at what position. It can take several values:\n- a negative value means that the element should be focusable, but should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation;\n0\nmeans that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but its relative order is defined by the platform convention;- a positive value means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation; the order in which the elements are focused is the increasing value of the\ntabindex\n. If several elements share the same tabindex, their relative order follows their relative positions in the document.\ntitle\n-\nContains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip.\ntranslate\n-\nAn enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an element's attribute values and the values of its\nText\nnode children are to be translated when the page is localized, or whether to leave them unchanged. It can have the following values:- empty string or\nyes\n, which indicates that the element will be translated. no\n, which indicates that the element will not be translated.\n- empty string or\nvirtualkeyboardpolicy\nExperimental-\nAn enumerated attribute used to control the on-screen virtual keyboard behavior on devices such as tablets, mobile phones, or other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available for elements that its content is editable (for example, it is an\n<input>\nor<textarea>\nelement, or an element with thecontenteditable\nattribute set).auto\nor an empty string, which automatically shows the virtual keyboard when the element is focused or tapped.manual\n, which decouples focus and tap on the element from the virtual keyboard's state.\nwritingsuggestions\n-\nAn enumerated attribute indicating if browser-provided writing suggestions should be enabled under the scope of the element or not.\nfalse\n, which disables the browser's writing suggestions.true\nor an empty string, which enables writing suggestions.\nList of global event handler attributes\nHTML event handler attributes are discouraged; see HTML attribute reference for how they work.\nWhile the attributes listed below apply to all elements, they are not useful on all elements. For example, onvolumechange\nHTML attribute is accepted by all elements and attaches an event listener for volumechange\n, but only media elements will ever receive a volumechange\nevent fired by the browser. For other elements, you can only use EventTarget.dispatchEvent()\nto manually dispatch one. Some attributes can be specified on <body>\n, but they would instead listen to events on window\n.\nonabort\nonanimationcancel\nonanimationend\nonanimationiteration\nonanimationstart\nonauxclick\nonbeforeinput\nonbeforematch\nonbeforetoggle\nonblur\noncancel\noncanplay\noncanplaythrough\nonchange\nonclick\nonclose\noncommand\noncontentvisibilityautostatechange\noncontextlost\noncontextmenu\noncontextrestored\noncopy\noncuechange\noncut\nondblclick\nondrag\nondragend\nondragenter\nondragleave\nondragover\nondragstart\nondrop\nondurationchange\nonemptied\nonended\nonerror\nonfocus\nonfocusin\nonfocusout\nonformdata\nonfullscreenchange\nonfullscreenerror\nongesturechange\nNon-standardongestureend\nNon-standardongesturestart\nNon-standardongotpointercapture\noninput\noninvalid\nonkeydown\nonkeypress\nDeprecatedonkeyup\nonload\nonloadeddata\nonloadedmetadata\nonloadstart\nonlostpointercapture\nonmousedown\nonmouseenter\nonmouseleave\nonmousemove\nonmouseout\nonmouseover\nonmouseup\nonmousewheel\nDeprecated Non-standardonpaste\nonpause\nonplay\nonplaying\nonpointercancel\nonpointerdown\nonpointerenter\nonpointerleave\nonpointermove\nonpointerout\nonpointerover\nonpointerrawupdate\nonpointerup\nonprogress\nonratechange\nonreset\nonresize\nonscroll\nonscrollend\nonscrollsnapchange\nExperimentalonscrollsnapchanging\nExperimentalonsecuritypolicyviolation\nonseeked\nonseeking\nonselect\nonselectionchange\nonselectstart\nonslotchange\nonstalled\nonsubmit\nonsuspend\nontimeupdate\nontoggle\nontouchcancel\nontouchend\nontouchmove\nontouchstart\nontransitioncancel\nontransitionend\nontransitionrun\nontransitionstart\nonvolumechange\nonwaiting\nonwebkitmouseforcechanged\nNon-standardonwebkitmouseforcedown\nNon-standardonwebkitmouseforceup\nNon-standardonwebkitmouseforcewillbegin\nNon-standardonwheel\nSpecifications\nBrowser compatibility\nSee also\nElement\ninterface that allows querying most global attributes."}

The content attribute is always a string even when the expected value should be an integer. For example, to set an <input>\nelement's maxlength\nto 42 using the content attribute, you have to call setAttribute(\"maxlength\", \"42\")\non that element.\nThe IDL attribute is also known as a JavaScript property. These are the attributes you can read or set using JavaScript properties like element.foo\n. The IDL attribute is always going to use (but might transform) the underlying content attribute to return a value when you get it and is going to save something in the content attribute when you set it. In other words, the IDL attributes, in essence, reflect the content attributes.\nMost of the time, IDL attributes will return their values as they are really used. For example, the default type\nfor <input>\nelements is \"text\", so if you set input.type=\"foobar\"\n, the <input>\nelement will be of type text (in the appearance and the behavior) but the \"type\" content attribute's value will be \"foobar\". However, the type\nIDL attribute will return the string \"text\".\nIDL attributes are not always strings; for example, input.maxlength\nis a number (a signed long). When using IDL attributes, you read or set values of the desired type, so input.maxlength\nis always going to return a number and when you set input.maxlength\n, it wants a number. If you pass another type, it is automatically converted to a number as specified by the standard JavaScript rules for type conversion.\nIDL attributes can reflect other types such as unsigned long, URLs, booleans, etc. Unfortunately, there are no clear rules and the way IDL attributes behave in conjunction with their corresponding content attributes depends on the attribute. Most of the time, it will follow the rules laid out in the specification, but sometimes it doesn't. HTML specifications try to make this as developer-friendly as possible, but for various reasons (mostly historical), some attributes behave oddly (select.size\n, for example) and you should read the specifications to understand how exactly they behave.\nBoolean Attributes\nSome content attributes (e.g., required\n, readonly\n, disabled\n) are called boolean attributes. If a boolean attribute is present, its value is true, and if it's absent, its value is false.\nHTML defines restrictions on the allowed values of boolean attributes: If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string (equivalently, the attribute may have an unassigned value), or a value that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace. The following examples are valid ways to mark up a boolean attribute:\n<div itemscope>This is valid HTML but invalid XML.</div>\n<div itemscope=itemscope>This is also valid HTML but invalid XML.</div>\n<div itemscope=\"\">This is valid HTML and also valid XML.</div>\n<div itemscope=\"itemscope\">\nThis is also valid HTML and XML, but perhaps a bit verbose.\n</div>\nTo be clear, the values \"true\"\nand \"false\"\nare not allowed on boolean attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to be omitted altogether. This restriction clears up some common misunderstandings: With checked=\"false\"\nfor example, the element's checked\nattribute would be interpreted as true because the attribute is present.\nEvent handler attributes\nWarning: The use of event handler content attributes is discouraged. The mix of HTML and JavaScript often produces unmaintainable code, and the execution of event handler attributes may also be blocked by content security policies.\nIn addition to the attributes listed in the table above, global event handlers â such as onclick\nâ can also be specified as content attributes on all elements.\nAll event handler attributes accept a string. The string will be used to synthesize a JavaScript function like function name(/*args*/) {body}\n, where name\nis the attribute's name, and body\nis the attribute's value. The handler receives the same parameters as its JavaScript event handler counterpart â most handlers receive only one event\nparameter, while onerror\nreceives five: event\n, source\n, lineno\n, colno\n, error\n. This means you can, in general, use the event\nvariable within the attribute.\n<div onclick=\"console.log(event)\">Click me!</div>\n<!-- The synthesized handler has a name; you can reference itself -->\n<div onclick=\"console.log(onclick)\">Click me!</div>"}

{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images", "title": "Using responsive images in HTML - HTML | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Using responsive images in HTML\nIn this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images â images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features â and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.\nWhy responsive images?\nLet's examine a typical scenario. A typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole of the width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column. Here's an example:\nThis works well on a wide screen device, such as a laptop or desktop (you can see the example live and find the source code on GitHub.) We won't discuss the CSS much in this lesson, except to say that:\n- The body content has been set to a maximum width of 1200 pixels â in viewports above that width, the body remains at 1200px and centers itself in the available space. In viewports below that width, the body will stay at 100% of the width of the viewport.\n- The header image has been set so that its center always stays in the center of the header, no matter what width the heading is set at. If the site is being viewed on a narrower screen, the important detail in the center of the image (the people) can still be seen, and the excess is lost off either side. It is 200px high.\n- The content images have been set so that if the body element becomes smaller than the image, the images start to shrink so that they always stay inside the body, rather than overflowing it.\nHowever, issues arise when you start to view the site on a narrow screen device. The header below looks OK, but it's starting to take up a lot of the screen height for a mobile device. And at this size, it is difficult to see faces of the two people within the first content image.\nAn improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details of the image when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. A second cropped image could be displayed for a medium-width screen device, like a tablet. The general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for various layouts, is commonly known as the art direction problem.\nIn addition, there is no need to embed such large images on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. Doing so can waste bandwidth; in particular, mobile users don't want to waste bandwidth by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device. Conversely, a small raster image starts to look grainy when displayed larger than its original size (a raster image is a set number of pixels wide and a set number of pixels tall). Ideally, multiple resolutions would be made available to the user's web browser. The browser could then determine the optimal resolution to load based on the screen size of the user's device. This is called the resolution switching problem.\nTo make things more complicated, some devices have high resolution screens that need larger images than you might expect to display nicely. This is essentially the same problem, but in a slightly different context.\nYou might think that vector images would solve these problems, and they do to a certain degree â they are small in file size and scale well, and you should use them wherever possible. However, they aren't suitable for all image types. Vector images are great for simple graphics, patterns, interface elements, etc., but it starts to get very complex to create a vector-based image with the kind of detail that you'd find in say, a photo. Raster image formats such as JPEGs are more suited to the kind of images we see in the above example.\nThis kind of problem didn't exist when the web first existed, in the early to mid 90s â back then the only devices in existence to browse the Web were desktops and laptops, so browser engineers and spec writers didn't even think to implement solutions. Responsive image technologies were implemented recently to solve the problems indicated above by letting you offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (resolution switching), or different images suitable for different space allocations (art direction).\nHow do you create responsive images?\nIn this section, we'll look at the two problems illustrated above and show how to solve them using HTML's responsive image features. You should note that we will be focusing on <img>\nelements for this section, as seen in the content area of the example above â the image in the site header is only for decoration, and therefore implemented using CSS background images. CSS arguably has better tools for responsive design than HTML, and we'll talk about those in a future CSS module.\nResolution switching: Different sizes\nSo, what is the problem that we want to solve with resolution switching? We want to display identical image content, just larger or smaller depending on the device â this is the situation we have with the second content image in our example. The standard <img>\nelement traditionally only lets you point the browser to a single source file:\n<img src=\"elva-fairy-800w.jpg\" alt=\"Elva dressed as a fairy\" />\nWe can however use two attributes â srcset\nand sizes\nâ to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. You can see an example of this in our responsive.html example on GitHub (see also the source code):\n<img\nsrcset=\"elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w\"\nsizes=\"(width <= 600px) 480px,\n800px\"\nsrc=\"elva-fairy-800w.jpg\"\nalt=\"Elva dressed as a fairy\" />\nThe srcset\nand sizes\nattributes look complicated, but they're not too hard to understand if you format them as shown above, with a different part of the attribute value on each line. Each value contains a comma-separated list, and each part of those lists is made up of three sub-parts. Let's run through the contents of each now:\nsrcset\ndefines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:\n- An image filename (\nelva-fairy-480w.jpg\n) - A space\n- The image's intrinsic width in pixels (\n480w\n) â note that this uses thew\nunit, notpx\nas you might expect. An image's intrinsic size is its real size, which can be found by inspecting the image file on your computer (for example, on a Mac you can select the image in Finder and press Cmd + I to bring up the info screen).\nsizes\ndefines a set of media conditions (e.g., screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true â these are the hints we talked about earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:\n- A media condition (\n(width <= 600px)\n) â you'll learn more about these in the CSS topic, but for now let's just say that a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying \"when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less\". - A space\n- The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true (\n480px\n)\nNote:\nIn sizes\n, you can use any length value. For example, rather than providing an absolute width (for example, 480px\n), you can alternatively provide a width relative to the viewport (for example, 50vw\n). However, you cannot use a percentage as the slot width. You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order the media conditions.\nSo, with these attributes in place, the browser will:\n- Look at screen size, pixel density, zoom level, screen orientation, and network speed.\n- Work out which media condition in the\nsizes\nlist is the first one to be true. - Look at the slot size given to that media query.\n- Load the image referenced in the\nsrcset\nlist that has the same size as the slot. If there isn't an exact match for the display size, the browser will choose the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size and scale it down to fit.\nAnd that's it! At this point, if a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the (width <= 600px)\nmedia condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the 480px\nslot. The elva-fairy-480w.jpg\nwill be loaded, as its inherent width (480w\n) is closest to the slot size. The 800px picture is 128KB on disk, whereas the 480px version is only 63KB â a saving of 65KB. Now, imagine if this was a page that had many pictures on it. Using this technique could save mobile users a lot of bandwidth.\nNote:\nWhen testing this with a desktop browser, if the browser fails to load the narrower images when you've got its window set to the narrowest width, have a look at what the viewport is (you can approximate it by going into the browser's JavaScript console and typing in document.querySelector('html').clientWidth\n). Different browsers have minimum sizes that they'll let you reduce the window width to, and they might be wider than you'd think. When testing it with a mobile browser, you can use tools like Firefox's about:debugging\npage to inspect the page loaded on the mobile using the desktop developer tools.\nTo see which images were loaded, you can use Firefox DevTools's Network Monitor tab or Chrome DevTools's Network panel. For Chrome, you may also want to disable cache to prevent it from picking already downloaded images.\nOlder browsers that don't support these features will just ignore them. Instead, those browsers will go ahead and load the image referenced in the src\nattribute as normal.\nNote:\nIn the <head>\nof the example linked above, you'll find the line <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n: this forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their viewport width, and instead load pages at a larger viewport width then shrink the loaded page down, which is not very helpful for responsive images or design).\nResolution switching: Same size, different resolutions\nSuppose you have an image that will be rendered at the same real-world size on displays that have different screen resolutions. You can provide a better user experience on high resolution displays by serving a higher resolution version of the image.\nTo achieve this you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcset\nwith x-descriptors and without sizes\nâ a somewhat easier syntax! You can find an example of what this looks like in srcset-resolutions.html (see also the source code):\n<img\nsrcset=\"elva-fairy-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x\"\nsrc=\"elva-fairy-640w.jpg\"\nalt=\"Elva dressed as a fairy\" />\nNote that even though the image is always displayed with the same size, on higher resolution displays you get to see more details.\nIn this example, the following CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen (also called CSS pixels):\nimg {\nwidth: 320px;\n}\nIn this case, sizes\nis not needed â the browser works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the srcset\n. So if the device accessing the page has a standard/low resolution display, with one device pixel representing each CSS pixel, the elva-fairy-320w.jpg\nimage will be loaded (the 1x is implied, so you don't need to include it.) If the device has a high resolution of two device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the elva-fairy-640w.jpg\nimage will be loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB.\nArt direction\nTo recap, the art direction problem involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes. For example, a web page includes a large landscape shot with a person in the middle when viewed on a desktop browser. When viewed on a mobile browser, that same image is shrunk down, making the person in the image very small and hard to see. It would probably be better to show a smaller, portrait image on mobile, which zooms in on the person. The <picture>\nelement allows us to implement just this kind of solution.\nReturning to our original not-responsive.html example, we have an image that badly needs art direction:\n<img src=\"elva-800w.jpg\" alt=\"Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva\" />\nLet's fix this, with <picture>\n! Like <video>\nand <audio>\n, the <picture>\nelement is a wrapper containing several <source>\nelements that provide different sources for the browser to choose from, followed by the all-important <img>\nelement. The code in responsive.html looks like so:\n<picture>\n<source media=\"(width < 800px)\" srcset=\"elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg\" />\n<source media=\"(width >= 800px)\" srcset=\"elva-800w.jpg\" />\n<img src=\"elva-800w.jpg\" alt=\"Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva\" />\n</picture>\n- The\n<source>\nelements include amedia\nattribute that contains a media condition â as with the firstsrcset\nexample, these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown â the first one that returns true will be displayed. In this case, if the viewport width is less than 800px wide, the first<source>\nelement's image will be displayed. If the viewport width is 800px or more, it'll be the second one. - The\nsrcset\nattributes contain the path to the image to display. Just as we saw with<img>\nabove,<source>\ncan take asrcset\nattribute with multiple images referenced, as well as asizes\nattribute. So, you could offer multiple images via a<picture>\nelement, but then also offer multiple resolutions of each one. Realistically, you probably won't want to do this kind of thing very often. - In all cases, you must provide an\n<img>\nelement, withsrc\nandalt\n, right before</picture>\n, otherwise no images will appear. This provides a default case that will apply when none of the media conditions return true (you could actually remove the second<source>\nelement in this example), and a fallback for browsers that don't support the<picture>\nelement.\nThis code allows us to display a suitable image on both wide screen and narrow screen displays, as shown below:\nNote:\nYou should use the media\nattribute only in art direction scenarios; when you do use media\n, don't also offer media conditions within the sizes\nattribute.\nWhy can't we just do this using CSS or JavaScript?\nWhen the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images â hence the need to implement solutions like srcset\n. For example, you couldn't load the <img>\nelement, then detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image as well, which is even worse in responsive image terms.\nImplementing your own responsive images\nIn this exercise, we're expecting you to be brave and do it alone, mostly. We want you to implement your own suitable art-directed narrow screen/wide screenshot using <picture>\n, and a resolution switching example that uses srcset\n.\n- Write some HTML to contain your code (use\nnot-responsive.html\nas a starting point, if you like). - Find a nice wide screen landscape image with some kind of detail contained in it somewhere. Create a web-sized version of it using a graphics editor, then crop it to show a smaller part that zooms in on the detail, and create a second image (about 480px wide is good for this).\n- Use the\n<picture>\nelement to implement an art direction picture switcher! - Create multiple image files of different sizes, each showing the same picture.\n- Use\nsrcset\n/sizes\nto create a resolution switcher example, either to serve the same size image at different resolutions depending on the device resolution or to serve different image sizes depending on the viewport widths.\nSummary\nThat's a wrap for responsive images â we hope you enjoyed playing with these new techniques. As a recap, there are two distinct problems we've been discussing here:\n- Art direction: The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts â for example a landscape image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in for a mobile layout. You can solve this problem using the\n<picture>\nelement. - Resolution switching: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow-screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do â and to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. You can solve this problem using vector graphics (SVG images) and the\nsrcset\nwithsizes\nattributes.\nSee also\n- Learn: Responsive design\n- Jason Grigsby's excellent introduction to responsive images\n- Responsive Images: If you're just changing resolutions, use srcset â includes more explanation of how the browser works out which image to use\n<img>\n<picture>\n<source>"}

That's the whole purpose of the cheat sheet, to give you some quick accurate ready to use code snippets for common usages.\nNote: HTML tags must be used for their semantic value, not their appearance. It's always possible to totally change the look and feel of a given tag using CSS so, when using HTML, take the time to focus on the meaning rather than the appearance.\nInline elements\nAn \"element\" is a single part of a webpage. Some elements are large and hold smaller elements like containers. Some elements are small and are \"nested\" inside larger ones. By default, \"inline elements\" appear next to one another in a webpage. They take up only as much width as they need in a page and fit together horizontally like words in a sentence or books shelved side-by-side in a row. All inline elements can be placed within the <body>\nelement.\n| Usage | Element | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| A link | <a> |\nhtml\n|\n| An image | <img> |\nhtml\n|\n| An inline container | <span> |\nhtml\n|\n| Emphasize text | <em> |\nhtml\n|\n| Italic text | <i> |\nhtml\n|\n| Bold text | <b> |\nhtml\n|\n| Important text | <strong> |\nhtml\n|\n| Highlight text | <mark> |\nhtml\n|\n| Strikethrough text | <s> |\nhtml\n|\n| Subscript | <sub> |\nhtml\n|\n| Small text | <small> |\nhtml\n|\n| Address | <address> |\nhtml\n|\n| Textual citation | <cite> |\nhtml\n|\n| Superscript | <sup> |\nhtml\n|\n| Inline quotation | <q> |\nhtml\n|\n| A line break | <br> |\nhtml\n|\n| A possible line break | <wbr> |\nhtml\n|\n| Date | <time> |\nhtml\n|\n| Code format | <code> |\nhtml\n|\n| Audio | <audio> |\nhtml\n|\n| Video | <video> |\nhtml\n|\nBlock elements\n\"Block elements,\" on the other hand, take up the entire width of a webpage.

The formats of the strings that specify these values are described in this article.\nElements that use such formats include certain forms of the <input>\nelement that let the user choose or specify a date, time, or both, as well as the <ins>\nand <del>\nelements, whose datetime\nattribute specifies the date or date and time at which the insertion or deletion of content occurred.\nFor <input>\n, the type\nvalues of inputs whose value\ncontains a string representing a date and/or time are:\nExamples\nBefore getting into the intricacies of how date and time strings are written and parsed in HTML, here are some examples that should give you a good idea what the more commonly-used date and time string formats look like.\n| String | Date and/or time | |\n|---|---|---|\n2005-06-07 |\nJune 7, 2005 | [details] |\n08:45 |\n8:45 AM | [details] |\n08:45:25 |\n8:45 AM and 25 seconds | [details] |\n0033-08-04T03:40 |\n3:40 AM on August 4, 33 | [details] |\n1977-04-01T14:00:30 |\n30 seconds after 2:00 PM on April 1, 1977 | [details] |\n1901-01-01T00:00Z |\nMidnight UTC on January 1, 1901 | [details] |\n1901-01-01T00:00:01-04:00 |\n1 second past midnight Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 1, 1901 | [details] |\nBasics\nBefore looking at the various formats of date and time related strings used by HTML elements, it is helpful to understand a few fundamental facts about the way they're defined. HTML uses a variation of the ISO 8601 standard for its date and time strings. It's worth reviewing the descriptions of the formats you're using in order to ensure that your strings are in fact compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification includes algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more precise than ISO 8601, so there can be subtle differences in how date and time strings are expected to look.\nCharacter set\nDates and times in HTML are always strings which use the ASCII character set.\nYear numbers\nIn order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in HTML, the specification requires that all years be given using the modern (or proleptic) Gregorian calendar. While user interfaces may allow entry of dates using other calendars, the underlying value always uses the Gregorian calendar.\nWhile the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582 (replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make sure any older dates account for this.\nFor the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four digits long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with leading zeroes (0\n), so the year 72 is written as 0072\n. Years prior to the year 1 C.E. are not supported, so HTML doesn't support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or earlier.\nA year is normally 365 days long, except during leap years.\nLeap years\nA leap year is any year which is divisible by 400 or the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100. Although the calendar year is normally 365 days long, it actually takes the planet Earth approximately 365.2422 days to complete a single orbit around the sun. Leap years help to adjust the calendar to keep it synchronized with the actual position of the planet in its orbit. Adding a day to the year every four years essentially makes the average year 365.25 days long, which is close to correct.\nThe adjustments to the algorithm (taking a leap year when the year can be divided by 400, and skipping leap years when the year is divisible by 100) help to bring the average even closer to the correct number of days (365.2425 days). Scientists occasionally add leap seconds to the calendar (seriously) to handle the remaining three ten-thousandths of a day and to compensate for the gradual, naturally occurring slowing of Earth's rotation.\nWhile month 02\n, February, normally has 28 days, it has 29 days in leap years.\nMonths of the year\nThere are 12 months in the year, numbered 1 through 12. They are always represented by a two-digit ASCII string whose value ranges from 01\nthrough 12\n. See the table in the section Days of the month for the month numbers and their corresponding names (and lengths in days).\nDays of the month\nMonth numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are 31 days long. Months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are 30 days long. Month 2, February, is 28 days long most years, but is 29 days long in leap years. This is detailed in the following table.\n| Month number | Name (English) | Length in days |\n|---|---|---|\n| 01 | January | 31 |\n| 02 | February | 28 (29 in leap years) |\n| 03 | March | 31 |\n| 04 | April | 30 |\n| 05 | May | 31 |\n| 06 | June | 30 |\n| 07 | July | 31 |\n| 08 | August | 31 |\n| 09 | September | 30 |\n| 10 | October | 31 |\n| 11 | November | 30 |\n| 12 | December | 31 |\nWeek strings\nA week string specifies a week within a particular year. A valid week string consists of a valid year number, followed by a hyphen character (-\n, or U+002D), then the capital letter W\n(U+0057), followed by a two-digit week of the year value.\nThe week of the year is a two-digit string between 01\nand 53\n. Each week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday. That means it's possible for the first few days of January to be considered part of the previous week-year, and for the last few days of December to be considered part of the following week-year. The first week of the year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year. For example, the first Thursday of 1953 was on January 1, so that weekâbeginning on Monday, December 29âis considered the first week of the year. Therefore, December 30, 1952 occurs during the week 1953-W01\n.\nA year has 53 weeks if:\n- The first day of the calendar year (January 1) is a Thursday or\n- The first day of the year (January 1) is a Wednesday and the year is a leap year\nAll other years have 52 weeks.\n| Week string | Week and year (Date range) |\n|---|---|\n2001-W37 |\nWeek 37, 2001 (September 10-16, 2001) |\n1953-W01 |\nWeek 1, 1953 (December 29, 1952-January 4, 1953) |\n1948-W53 |\nWeek 53, 1948 (December 27, 1948-January 2, 1949) |\n1949-W01 |\nWeek 1, 1949 (January 3-9, 1949) |\n0531-W16 |\nWeek 16, 531 (April 13-19, 531) |\n0042-W04 |\nWeek 4, 42 (January 21-27, 42) |\nNote that both the year and week numbers are padded with leading zeroes, with the year padded to four digits and the week to two.\nMonth strings\nA month string represents a specific month in time, rather than a generic month of the year. That is, rather than representing \"January,\" an HTML month string represents a month and year paired, like \"January 1972.\"\nA valid month string consists of a valid year number (a string of at least four digits), followed by a hyphen character (-\n, or U+002D), followed by a two-digit numeric month number, where 01\nrepresents January and 12\nrepresents December.\n| Month string | Month and year |\n|---|---|\n17310-09 |\nSeptember, 17310 |\n2019-01 |\nJanuary, 2019 |\n1993-11 |\nNovember, 1993 |\n0571-04 |\nApril, 571 |\n0001-07 |\nJuly, 1 C.E. |\nNotice that all years are at least four characters long; years that are fewer than four digits long are padded with leading zeroes.\nDate strings\nA valid date string consists of a month string, followed by a hyphen character (-\n, or U+002D), followed by a two-digit day of the month.\n| Date string | Full date |\n|---|---|\n1993-11-01 |\nNovember 1, 1993 |\n1066-10-14 |\nOctober 14, 1066 |\n0571-04-22 |\nApril 22, 571 |\n0062-02-05 |\nFebruary 5, 62 |\nTime strings\nA time string can specify a time with precision to the minute, second, or to the millisecond. Specifying only the hour or minute isn't permitted. A valid time string minimally consists of a two-digit hour followed by a colon (:\n, U+003A), then a two-digit minute. The minute may optionally be followed by another colon and a two-digit number of seconds. Milliseconds may be specified, optionally, by adding a decimal point character (.\n, U+002E) followed by one, two, or three digits.\nThere are some additional basic rules:\n- The hour is always specified using the 24-hour clock, with\n00\nbeing midnight and 11 PM being23\n. No values outside the range00\nâ23\nare permitted. - The minute must be a two-digit number between\n00\nand59\n. No values outside that range are allowed. - If the number of seconds is omitted (to specify a time accurate only to the minute), no colon should follow the number of minutes.\n- If specified, the integer portion of the number of seconds must be between\n00\nand59\n. You cannot specify leap seconds by using values like60\nor61\n. - If the number of seconds is specified and is an integer, it must not be followed by a decimal point.\n- If a fraction of a second is included, it may be from one to three digits long, indicating the number of milliseconds. It follows the decimal point placed after the seconds component of the time string.\n| Time string | Time |\n|---|---|\n00:00:30.75 |\n12:00:30.75 AM (30.75 seconds after midnight) |\n12:15 |\n12:15 PM |\n13:44:25 |\n1:44:25 PM (25 seconds after 1:44 PM) |\nLocal date and time strings\nA valid datetime-local\nstring consists of a date\nstring and a time\nstring concatenated together with either the letter T\nor a space character separating them. No information about the time zone is included in the string; the date and time is presumed to be in the user's local time zone.\nWhen you set the value\nof a datetime-local\ninput, the string is normalized into a standard form. Normalized datetime\nstrings always use the letter T\nto separate the date and the time, and the time portion of the string is as short as possible. This is done by leaving out the seconds component if its value is :00\n.\n| Date/time string | Normalized date/time string | Actual date and time |\n|---|---|---|\n1986-01-28T11:38:00.01 |\n1986-01-28T11:38:00.01 |\nJanuary 28, 1986 at 11:38:00.01 AM |\n1986-01-28 11:38:00.010 |\nNote that after normalization, this is the same string as the previous\n|\nJanuary 28, 1986 at 11:38:00.01 AM |\n0170-07-31T22:00:00 |\nNote that the normalized form of this date drops the\n|\nJuly 31, 170 at 10:00 PM |\nGlobal date and time strings\nA global date and time string specifies a date and time as well as the time zone in which it occurs. A valid global date and time string is the same format as a local date and time string, except it has a time zone string appended to the end, following the time.\nTime zone offset string\nA time zone offset string specifies the offset in either a positive or a negative number of hours and minutes from the standard time base. There are two standard time bases, which are very close to the same, but not exactly the same:\n- For dates after the establishment of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the early 1960s, the time base is\nZ\nand the offset indicates a particular time zone's offset from the time at the prime meridian at 0Âº longitude (which passes through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England). - For dates prior to UTC, the time base is instead expressed in terms of UT1, which is the contemporary Earth solar time at the prime meridian.\nThe time zone string is appended immediately following the time in the date and time string. You can specify Z\nas the time zone offset string to indicate that the time is specified in UTC. Otherwise, the time zone string is constructed as follows:\n- A character indicating the sign of the offset: the plus character (\n+\n, or U+002B) for time zones to the east of the prime meridian or the minus character (-\n, or U+002D) for time zones to the west of the prime meridian. - A two-digit number of hours that the time zone is offset from the prime meridian. This value must be between\n00\nand23\n. - An optional colon (\n:\n) character. - A two-digit number of minutes past the hour; this value must be between\n00\nand59\n.\nWhile this format allows for time zones between -23:59 and +23:59, the current range of time zone offsets is -12:00 to +14:00, and no time zones are currently offset from the hour by anything other than 00\n, 30\n, or 45\nminutes. This may change at more or less anytime, since countries are free to tamper with their time zones at any time and in any way they wish to do so.\n| Global date and time string | Actual global date and time | Date and time at prime meridian |\n|---|---|---|\n2005-06-07T00:00Z |\nJune 7, 2005 at midnight UTC | June 7, 2005 at midnight |\n1789-08-22T12:30:00.1-04:00 |\nAugust 22, 1789 at a tenth of a second past 12:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) | August 22, 1789 at a tenth of a second past 4:30 PM |\n3755-01-01 00:00+10:00 |\nJanuary 1, 3755 at midnight Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) | December 31, 3754 at 2:00 PM |\nDate issues\nBecause of data storage and precision issues, you may want to be aware of a few client-side and server-side issues.\nThe Y2K38 Problem (often server-side)\nJavaScript uses double precision floating points to store dates, as with all numbers, meaning that JavaScript code will not suffer from the Y2K38 problem unless integer coercion/bit-hacks are used because all JavaScript bit operators use 32-bit signed 2s-complement integers.\nThe problem is with the server side of things: storage of dates greater than 2^31 - 1. To fix this problem, you must store all dates using either unsigned 32-bit integers, signed 64-bit integers, or double-precision floating points on the server. If your server is written in PHP, the fix may require upgrading your PHP to a more recent version, and upgrading your hardware to x86_64 or IA64. If you are stuck with other hardware, you can try to emulate 64-bit hardware inside a 32-bit virtual machine, but most VMs don't support this kind of virtualization, since stability may suffer, and performance will definitely suffer greatly.\nThe Y10k Problem (often client-side)\nIn many servers, dates are stored as numbers instead of as strings--numbers of a fixed size and agnostic of format (aside from endianness). After the year 10,000, those numbers will just be a bit bigger than before, so many servers will not see issues with forms submitted after the year 10,000.\nThe problem is with the client side of things: parsing of dates with more than 4 digits in the year.\n<!--midnight of January 1st, 10000: the exact time of Y10K-->\n<input type=\"datetime-local\" value=\"+010000-01-01T05:00\" />\nWe need to prepare our code for any number of digits â not just 5. The following JavaScript function programmatically sets the value:\nfunction setValue(element, date) {\nconst isoString = date.toISOString();\nelement.value = isoString.substring(0, isoString.indexOf(\"T\") + 6);\n}\nWhy worry about the Y10K problem if it is going to happen many centuries after your death? Exactly because you will already be dead, so the companies using your software will be stuck using your software without any other coder who knows the system well enough to come in and fix it.\nSee also\n<input>\n<ins>\nand<del>\n: see thedatetime\nattribute, which specifies either a date or a local date and time at which the content was inserted or deleted- The ISO 8601 specification\n- Representing dates & times in the JavaScript Guide\n- The JavaScript\nDate\nobject - The\nIntl.DateTimeFormat\nobject for formatting dates and times for a given locale"}

When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.\n- Using date and time formats in HTML\nCertain HTML elements use date and/or time values. The formats of the strings that specify these values are described in this article.\n- Using HTML comments <!-- â¦ -->\nAn HTML comment is used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.\n- Using HTML form validation and the Constraint Validation API\nThe creation of web forms has always been a complex task. While marking up the form itself is easy, checking whether each field has a valid and coherent value is more difficult, and informing the user about the problem may become a headache. HTML5 introduced new mechanisms for forms: it added new semantic types for the\ninput\nelement and constraint validation to ease the work of checking the form content on the client side. Basic, usual constraints can be checked, without the need for JavaScript, by setting new attributes; more complex constraints can be tested using the Constraint Validation API.- Using microdata in HTML\nMicrodata is part of the WHATWG HTML Standard and is used to nest metadata within existing content on web pages. Search engines and web crawlers can extract and process microdata from a web page and use it to provide a richer browsing experience for users. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide more relevant results to users. Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary to describe an item and name-value pairs to assign values to its properties. Microdata is an attempt to provide a declarative way of annotating HTML elements with machine-readable tags than the similar approaches of using RDFa and classic microformats.\n- Using microformats in HTML\nMicroformats are standards used to embed semantics and structured data in HTML, and provide an API to be used by social web applications, search engines, aggregators, and other tools. These minimal patterns of HTML are used for marking up entities that range from fundamental to domain-specific information, such as people, organizations, events, and locations.\n- Using responsive images in HTML\nIn this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images â images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features â and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices."}

SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.\nSVG images and their related behaviors are defined in XML text files, which means they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Additionally, this means they can be created and edited with any text editor or with drawing software.\nCompared to classic bitmapped image formats such as JPEG or PNG, SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality and can be easily localized by updating the text within them, without the need of a graphical editor to do so. With proper libraries, SVG files can even be localized on-the-fly.\nSVG has been developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.\nTutorials\nThe SVG tutorials are designed to walk you through subjects assuming that you have no prior experience, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced techniques.\n- Introducing SVG from scratch\n-\nThis tutorial aims to explain the internals of SVG and is packed with technical details. If you just want to draw beautiful images, you might find more useful resources at Inkscape's documentation page. Another good introduction to SVG is provided by the W3C's SVG Primer. Also check out this advent calendar-themed SVG Tutorial that walks you through coding 25 festive SVGs.\nGuides\nThe SVG guides help you work with SVG on the web, covering topics such as embedding, MIME (media) types, handling scripts, animations, filters, and more.\n- Applying SVG effects to HTML content\n-\nModern browsers support using SVG within CSS styles to apply graphical effects to HTML content.\n- Content type\n-\nSVG makes use of a number of data types. This article lists these types along with their syntax and descriptions of what they're used for.\n- Namespaces crash course\n-\nNamespaces are essential to user agents that support multiple XML dialects. Browsers must be very strict; taking the time to understand namespaces now will save you from future headaches.\n- Scripting\n-\nThere are several ways to create and manipulate SVG using JavaScript. This document describes event handling, interactivity and working with embedded SVG content.\n- SVG animation with SMIL\n-\nSMIL is an XML-based language for writing interactive multimedia presentations. Authors can use SMIL syntax in SVG to define the timing and layout of elements for animation.\n- SVG as an image\n-\nSVG can be used as an image format in HTML, CSS, certain SVG elements, and via the Canvas API. This page lists the features where you can provide SVG as an image source.\n- SVG filters\n-\nSVG supports filters so authors can apply effects such as a shadow or blur, or even merge the results of different filters.\n- SVG in HTML introduction\n-\nThis article shows how to use inline SVG and includes examples for illustration.\nReference\nThe SVG reference documentation contains comprehensive information about elements, attributes, and DOM interfaces, and lists relevant specifications and standards documents.\n- SVG elements\n-\nThe SVG elements used to construct, draw, and layout vector graphics.\n- SVG attributes\n-\nThe SVG attributes available that can be used to specify how an element should be handled or rendered.\n- SVG DOM interface\n-\nThe SVG DOM API for interacting with SVG using JavaScript."}

Itâs been available across browsers since â¨January 2023â©.\nMathematical Markup Language (MathML) is an XML-based language for describing mathematical notation.\nMathML was originally designed as a general-purpose specification for browsers, office suites, computer algebra systems, EPUB readers, LaTeX-based generators. However, this approach was not very adapted to the Web: the subset focusing on semantics has never been implemented in browsers while the subset focusing on math layout led to incomplete and inconsistent browser implementations.\nMathML Core is a subset with increased implementation details based on rules from LaTeX and the Open Font Format. It is tailored for browsers and designed specifically to work well with other web standards including HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript.\nBelow you will find links to documentation, examples, and tools to work with MathML. MDN uses MathML Core as a reference specification but, due to an erratic standardization history, legacy MathML features may still show up in existing implementations and web content.\nNote: It is highly recommended that developers and authors switch to MathML Core, perhaps relying on other web technologies to cover missing use cases.

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.\nCSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just \"CSS\" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.\nAfter CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.\nBeginner's tutorials\nOur learn web development core modules contain modern, up-to-date tutorials covering CSS fundamentals.\n- Your first website: Styling the content\n-\nThis article provides a brief tour of what CSS is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.\n- CSS styling basics\n-\nThis module provides all the CSS fundamentals you'll need to start learning the technology effectively, including syntax, features, and techniques.\n- CSS text styling\n-\nHere we look at CSS text fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, and drop shadows.

{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Box_model/Introduction", "title": "Introduction to the CSS box model - CSS | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Introduction to the CSS box model\nWhen laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS basic box model. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.\nEvery box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.\nContent area\nThe content area, bounded by the content edge, contains the \"real\" content of the element, such as text, an image, or a video player. Its dimensions are the content width (or content-box width) and the content height (or content-box height). It often has a background color or background image.\nIf the box-sizing\nproperty is set to content-box\n(default) and if the element is a block element, the content area's size can be explicitly defined with the width\n, min-width\n, max-width\n, height\n, min-height\n, and max-height\nproperties.\nPadding area\nThe padding area, bounded by the padding edge, extends the content area to include the element's padding. Its dimensions are the padding-box width and the padding-box height.\nThe thickness of the padding is determined by the padding-top\n, padding-right\n, padding-bottom\n, padding-left\n, and shorthand padding\nproperties.\nBorder area\nThe border area, bounded by the border edge, extends the padding area to include the element's borders. Its dimensions are the border-box width and the border-box height.\nThe thickness of the borders are determined by the border-width\nand shorthand border\nproperties. If the box-sizing\nproperty is set to border-box\n, the border area's size can be explicitly defined with the width\n, min-width\n, max-width\n, height\n, min-height\n, and max-height\nproperties. When there is a background (background-color\nor background-image\n) set on a box, it extends to the outer edge of the border (i.e., extends underneath the border in z-ordering). This default behavior can be altered with the background-clip\nCSS property.\nMargin area\nThe margin area, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors. Its dimensions are the margin box width and the margin box height.\nThe size of the margin area is determined by the margin-top\n, margin-right\n, margin-bottom\n, margin-left\n, and shorthand margin\nproperties. When margin collapsing occurs, the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes.\nFinally, note that for non-replaced inline elements, the amount of space taken up (the contribution to the height of the line) is determined by the line-height\nproperty, even though the borders and padding are still displayed around the content.\nSee also\n- CSS box model module\n- Layout and the containing block\n- Introducing the CSS Cascade\n- Learn: Handling conflicts\n- CSS key concepts:"}
{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Animations/Using", "title": "Using CSS animations - CSS | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Using CSS animations\nCSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components: a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.\nThere are three key advantages to CSS animations over traditional script-driven animation techniques:\n- You can create basic animations with a few lines of CSS; no JavaScript required.\n- The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in JavaScript. The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible.\n- Letting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency by, for example, reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren't currently visible.\nConfiguring an animation\nTo create a CSS animation sequence, you style the element you want to animate with the animation\nproperty or its sub-properties. This lets you configure the timing, duration, and other details of how the animation sequence should progress. This does not configure the actual appearance of the animation, which is done using the @keyframes\nat-rule as described in the Defining animation sequence using keyframes section below.\nThe sub-properties of the animation\nproperty are:\nanimation-composition\n-\nSpecifies the composite operation to use when multiple animations affect the same property simultaneously. This property is not part of the\nanimation\nshorthand property. animation-delay\n-\nSpecifies the delay between an element loading and the start of an animation sequence and whether the animation should start immediately from its beginning or partway through the animation.\nanimation-direction\n-\nSpecifies whether an animation's first iteration should be forward or backward and whether subsequent iterations should alternate direction on each run through the sequence or reset to the start point and repeat.\nanimation-duration\n-\nSpecifies the length of time in which an animation completes one cycle.\nanimation-fill-mode\n-\nSpecifies how an animation applies styles to its target before and after it runs.\nNote: In the case of animation forwards fill mode, animated properties behave as if included in a set\nwill-change\nproperty value. If a new stacking context was created during the animation, the target element retains the stacking context after the animation has finished. animation-iteration-count\n-\nSpecifies the number of times an animation should repeat.\nanimation-name\n-\nSpecifies the name of the\n@keyframes\nat-rule describing an animation's keyframes. animation-play-state\n-\nSpecifies whether to pause or play an animation sequence.\nanimation-timeline\n-\nSpecifies the timeline that is used to control the progress of a CSS animation.\nanimation-timing-function\n-\nSpecifies how an animation transitions through keyframes by establishing acceleration curves.\nDefining an animation sequence using keyframes\nAfter you've configured the animation's timing, you need to define the appearance of the animation. This is done by establishing one or more keyframes using the @keyframes\nat-rule. Each keyframe describes how the animated element should render at a given time during the animation sequence.\nSince the timing of the animation is defined in the CSS style that configures the animation, keyframes use a <percentage>\nto indicate the time during the animation sequence at which they take place. 0% indicates the first moment of the animation sequence, while 100% indicates the final state of the animation. Because these two times are so important, they have special aliases: from\nand to\n. Both are optional. If from\n/0%\nor to\n/100%\nis not specified, the browser starts or finishes the animation using the computed values of all attributes.\nYou can optionally include additional keyframes that describe intermediate steps between the start and end of the animation.\nUsing the animation shorthand\nThe animation\nshorthand is useful for saving space. As an example, some of the rules we've been using through this article:\np {\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-name: slide-in;\nanimation-iteration-count: infinite;\nanimation-direction: alternate;\n}\n...could be replaced by using the animation\nshorthand.\np {\nanimation: 3s infinite alternate slide-in;\n}\nTo learn more about the sequence in which different animation property values can be specified using the animation\nshorthand, see the animation\nreference page.\nSetting multiple animation property values\nThe CSS animation longhand properties can accept multiple values, separated by commas. This feature can be used when you want to apply multiple animations in a single rule and set different durations, iteration counts, etc., for each of the animations. Let's look at some quick examples to explain the different permutations.\nIn this first example, there are three duration and three iteration count values. So each animation is assigned a value of duration and iteration count with the same position as the animation name. The fadeInOut\nanimation is assigned a duration of 2.5s\nand an iteration count of 2\n, and the bounce\nanimation is assigned a duration of 1s\nand an iteration count of 5\n.\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 2.5s, 5s, 1s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 2, 1, 5;\nIn this second example, three animation names are set, but there's only one duration and iteration count. In this case, all three animations are given the same duration and iteration count.\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 1;\nIn this third example, three animations are specified, but only two durations and iteration counts. In such cases where there are not enough values in the list to assign a separate one to each animation, the value assignment cycles from the first to the last item in the available list and then cycles back to the first item. So, fadeInOut\ngets a duration of 2.5s\n, and moveLeft300px\ngets a duration of 5s\n, which is the last value in the list of duration values. The duration value assignment now resets to the first value; bounce\n, therefore, gets a duration of 2.5s\n. The iteration count values (and any other property values you specify) will be assigned in the same way.\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 2.5s, 5s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 2, 1;\nIf the mismatch in the number of animations and animation property values is inverted, say there are five animation-duration\nvalues for three animation-name\nvalues, then the extra or unused animation property values, in this case, two animation-duration\nvalues, don't apply to any animation and are ignored.\nExamples\n>Making text slide across the browser window\nThis basic example styles a <p>\nelement using the translate\nand scale\ntransition properties so that the text slides in from off the right edge of the browser window.\np {\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-name: slide-in;\n}\n@keyframes slide-in {\nfrom {\ntranslate: 150vw 0;\nscale: 200% 1;\n}\nto {\ntranslate: 0 0;\nscale: 100% 1;\n}\n}\nIn this example, the style for the <p>\nelement specifies that the animation should take 3 seconds to execute from start to finish, using the animation-duration\nproperty and that the name of the @keyframes\nat-rule defining the keyframes for the animation sequence is slide-in\n.\nIn this case, we have just two keyframes. The first occurs at 0%\n(using the alias from\n). Here, we configure the translate\nproperty of the element to be at 150vw\n(that is, beyond the far right edge of the containing element), and the scale\nof the element to be 200% (or two times its default inline size), causing the paragraph to be twice as wide as its <body>\ncontaining block. This causes the first frame of the animation to have the header drawn off the right edge of the browser window.\nThe second keyframe occurs at 100%\n(using the alias to\n). The translate\nproperty is set to 0%\nand the scale\nof the element is set to 1\n, which is 100%\n. This causes the header to finish its animation in its default state, flush against the left edge of the content area.\n<p>\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at\nlast the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a\nlanguid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\nNote: Reload page to see the animation.\nAdding another keyframe animation\nLet's add another keyframe to the previous example's animation. Let's say we want Alice's name to turn pink and grow and then shrink back to its original size and color as it moves from right to left. While we could change the font-size\n, changing any properties that impact the box model negatively impacts performance. Instead, we wrap her name in a <span>\nand then scale and assign a color to that separately. That requires adding a second animation impacting only the <span>\n:\n@keyframes grow-shrink {\n25%,\n75% {\nscale: 100%;\n}\n50% {\nscale: 200%;\ncolor: magenta;\n}\n}\nThe full code now looks like this:\np {\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-name: slide-in;\n}\np span {\ndisplay: inline-block;\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-name: grow-shrink;\n}\n@keyframes slide-in {\nfrom {\ntranslate: 150vw 0;\nscale: 200% 1;\n}\nto {\ntranslate: 0 0;\nscale: 100% 1;\n}\n}\n@keyframes grow-shrink {\n25%,\n75% {\nscale: 100%;\n}\n50% {\nscale: 200%;\ncolor: magenta;\n}\n}\nWe've added a <span>\naround \"Alice\":\n<p>\nThe Caterpillar and <span>Alice</span> looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\nThis tells the browser the name should be normal for the first and last 25% of the animation, but turn pink while being scaled up and back again in the middle. We set the spans's display\nproperty to inline-block\nas the transform\nproperties do not affect non-replaced inline-level content.\nNote: Reload page to see the animation.\nRepeating the animation\nTo make the animation repeat itself, use the animation-iteration-count\nproperty to indicate how many times to repeat the animation. In this case, let's use infinite\nto have the animation repeat indefinitely:\np {\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-name: slide-in;\nanimation-iteration-count: infinite;\n}\nMaking the animation move back and forth\nThat made it repeat, but it's very odd having it jump back to the start each time it begins animating. What we really want is for it to move back and forth across the screen. That's easily accomplished by setting animation-direction\nto alternate\n:\np {\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-name: slide-in;\nanimation-iteration-count: infinite;\nanimation-direction: alternate;\n}\nUsing animation events\nYou can get additional control over animations â as well as useful information about them â by making use of animation events. These events, represented by the AnimationEvent\nobject, can be used to detect when animations start, finish, and begin a new iteration. Each event includes the time at which it occurred as well as the name of the animation that triggered the event.\nWe'll modify the sliding text example to output some information about each animation event when it occurs, so we can get a look at how they work.\nWe've included the same keyframe animation as the previous example. This animation will last 3 seconds, be called \"slide-in\", repeat 3 times, and travel in an alternate direction each time. In the @keyframes\n, the scale and translation are manipulated along the x-axis to make the element slide across the screen.\n.slide-in {\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-name: slide-in;\nanimation-iteration-count: 3;\nanimation-direction: alternate;\n}\nAdding the animation event listeners\nWe'll use JavaScript code to listen for all three possible animation events. This code configures our event listeners; we call it when the document is first loaded in order to set things up.\nconst element = document.getElementById(\"watch-me\");\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationstart\", listener);\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationend\", listener);\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationiteration\", listener);\nelement.className = \"slide-in\";\nThis is pretty standard code; you can get details on how it works in the documentation for eventTarget.addEventListener()\n. The last thing this code does is set the class\non the element we'll be animating to \"slide-in\"; we do this to start the animation.\nWhy? Because the animationstart\nevent fires as soon as the animation starts, and in our case, that happens before our code runs. So we'll start the animation ourselves by setting the class of the element to the style that gets animated after the fact.\nReceiving the events\nThe events get delivered to the listener()\nfunction, which is shown below.\nfunction listener(event) {\nconst l = document.createElement(\"li\");\nswitch (event.type) {\ncase \"animationstart\":\nl.textContent = `Started: elapsed time is ${event.elapsedTime}`;\nbreak;\ncase \"animationend\":\nl.textContent = `Ended: elapsed time is ${event.elapsedTime}`;\nbreak;\ncase \"animationiteration\":\nl.textContent = `New loop started at time ${event.elapsedTime}`;\nbreak;\n}\ndocument.getElementById(\"output\").appendChild(l);\n}\nThis code, too, is very simple. It looks at the event.type\nto determine which kind of animation event occurred, then adds an appropriate note to the <ul>\n(unordered list) we're using to log these events.\nThe output, when all is said and done, looks something like this:\n- Started: elapsed time is 0\n- New loop started at time 3.01200008392334\n- New loop started at time 6.00600004196167\n- Ended: elapsed time is 9.234000205993652\nNote that the times are very close to, but not exactly, those expected given the timing established when the animation was configured. Note also that after the final iteration of the animation, the animationiteration\nevent isn't sent; instead, the animationend\nevent is sent.\nJust for the sake of completeness, here's the HTML that displays the page content, including the list into which the script inserts information about the received events:\n<h1 id=\"watch-me\">Watch me move</h1>\n<p>\nThis example shows how to use CSS animations to make <code>H1</code>\nelements move across the page.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition, we output some text each time an animation event fires, so you\ncan see them in action.\n</p>\n<ul id=\"output\"></ul>\nAnd here's the live output.\nNote: Reload page to see the animation.\nAnimating display and content-visibility\nThis example demonstrates how display\nand content-visibility\ncan be animated. This behavior is useful for creating entry/exit animations where you want to for example remove a container from the DOM with display: none\n, but have it fade out smoothly with opacity\nrather than disappearing immediately.\nSupporting browsers animate display\nand content-visibility\nwith a variation on the discrete animation type. This generally means that properties will flip between two values 50% of the way through animating between the two.\nThere is an exception, however, which is when animating to/from display: none\nor content-visibility: hidden\nto a visible value. In this case, the browser will flip between the two values so that the animated content is shown for the entire animation duration.\nSo for example:\n- When animating\ndisplay\nfromnone\ntoblock\n(or another visibledisplay\nvalue), the value will flip toblock\nat0%\nof the animation duration so it is visible throughout. - When animating\ndisplay\nfromblock\n(or another visibledisplay\nvalue) tonone\n, the value will flip tonone\nat100%\nof the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\nHTML\nThe HTML contains two <p>\nelements with a <div>\nin between that we will animate from display\nnone\nto block\n.\n<p>\nClick anywhere on the screen or press any key to toggle the\n<code><div></code> between hidden and showing.\n</p>\n<div>\nThis is a <code><div></code> element that animates between\n<code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and\n<code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?\n</div>\n<p>\nThis is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none;</code> is being\napplied and removed on the above <code><div> </code>. If only its\n<code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up the space in\nthe DOM.\n</p>\nCSS\nhtml {\nheight: 100vh;\n}\ndiv {\nfont-size: 1.6rem;\npadding: 20px;\nborder: 3px solid red;\nborder-radius: 20px;\nwidth: 480px;\nopacity: 0;\ndisplay: none;\n}\n/* Animation classes */\ndiv.fade-in {\ndisplay: block;\nanimation: fade-in 0.7s ease-in forwards;\n}\ndiv.fade-out {\nanimation: fade-out 0.7s ease-out forwards;\n}\n/* Animation keyframes */\n@keyframes fade-in {\n0% {\nopacity: 0;\ndisplay: none;\n}\n100% {\nopacity: 1;\ndisplay: block;\n}\n}\n@keyframes fade-out {\n0% {\nopacity: 1;\ndisplay: block;\n}\n100% {\nopacity: 0;\ndisplay: none;\n}\n}\nNote the inclusion of the display\nproperty in the keyframe animations.\nJavaScript\nFinally, we include a bit of JavaScript to set up event listeners to trigger the animations. Specifically, we add the fade-in\nclass to the <div>\nwhen we want it to appear, and fade-out\nwhen we want it to disappear.\nconst divElem = document.querySelector(\"div\");\nconst htmlElem = document.querySelector(\":root\");\nhtmlElem.addEventListener(\"click\", showHide);\ndocument.addEventListener(\"keydown\", showHide);\nfunction showHide() {\nif (divElem.classList[0] === \"fade-in\") {\ndivElem.classList.remove(\"fade-in\");\ndivElem.classList.add(\"fade-out\");\n} else {\ndivElem.classList.remove(\"fade-out\");\ndivElem.classList.add(\"fade-in\");\n}\n}\nResult\nThe code renders as follows:"}
{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts", "title": "Basic concepts of flexbox - CSS | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Basic concepts of flexbox\nThe flexible box layout module (usually referred to as flexbox) is a one-dimensional layout model for distributing space between items and includes numerous alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will explore in more detail in the rest of these guides.\nWhen we describe flexbox as being one-dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time â either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.\nThe two axes of flexbox\nWhen working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction\nproperty, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.\nThe main axis\nThe main axis is defined by flex-direction\n, which has four possible values:\nrow\nrow-reverse\ncolumn\ncolumn-reverse\nShould you choose row\nor row-reverse\n, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.\nChoose column\nor column-reverse\nand your main axis will run in the block direction, from the top of the page to the bottom.\nThe cross axis\nThe cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis. Therefore, if your flex-direction\n(main axis) is set to row\nor row-reverse\nthe cross axis runs down the columns.\nIf your main axis is column\nor column-reverse\nthen the cross axis runs along the rows.\nStart and end lines\nAnother vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. Flexbox doesn't just assume that all lines of text start at the top left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other. Rather, it supports all writing modes, like other logical properties and values.\nYou can read more about the relationship between flexbox and writing modes in a later article; however, the following description should help explain why we do not talk about left and right and top and bottom when we describe the direction that our flex items flow in.\nIf the flex-direction\nis row\nand I am working in English, then the start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right.\nIf I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and the end edge on the left.\nIn both cases the start edge of the cross-axis is at the top of the flex container and the end edge at the bottom, as both languages have a horizontal writing mode.\nAfter a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and right becomes natural, and will be useful to you when dealing with other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout which follow the same patterns.\nThe flex container\nAn area of a document that is laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. To create a flex container, set the area's display\nproperty to flex\n. When we do this, the direct children of that container become flex items. You can explicitly control whether the container itself is displayed inline or in block formatting context using inline flex\nor inline-flex\nfor inline flex containers or block flex\nor flex\nfor block level flex containers.\nInitial values\nAs with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so the contents of a new flex container will behave in the following way:\n- Items display in a row (the\nflex-direction\nproperty's default value isrow\n). - The items start from the start edge of the main axis.\n- The items do not stretch on the main dimension but can shrink (a flex-item's\nflex-grow\nproperty's default value is0\nand itsflex-shrink\nproperty's default value is1\n). - The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross-axis (the\nalign-items\nproperty's default value isstretch\n). - The flex-item's\nflex-basis\nproperty's default value isauto\n. This means that, in each case, it will be equal to the flex itemwidth\nin horizontal writing mode, and the flex itemheight\nin vertical writing mode. If the correspondingwidth\n/height\nis also set toauto\n, theflex-basis\ncontent\nvalue is used instead. - All the items will be in a single row (the\nflex-wrap\nproperty's default value isnowrap\n), overflowing their container if their combinedwidth\n/height\nexceeds the containing elementwidth\n/height\n.\nThe result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the full length of the cross-axis.\nYou can see in the live sample below how this looks. Click \"Play\" to open the example in the MDN Playground and edit the items or add new items to try out the initial behavior of flexbox:\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div>One</div>\n<div>Two</div>\n<div>Three <br />has <br />extra <br />text</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n.box {\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\n}\nChanging flex-direction\nAdding the flex-direction\nproperty to the flex container allows us to change the direction in which our flex items display. Setting flex-direction: row-reverse\nwill keep the items displaying along the row, however the start and end lines are switched.\nIf we change flex-direction\nto column\nthe main axis switches and our items now display in a column. Set column-reverse\nand the start and end lines are again switched.\nThe live sample below has flex-direction\nset to row-reverse\n. Try the other values â row\n, column\nand column-reverse\nâ to see what happens to the content.\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div>One</div>\n<div>Two</div>\n<div>Three</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n.box {\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: row-reverse;\n}\nMulti-line flex containers with flex-wrap\nWhile flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to make flex items wrap across multiple lines. If you do this, you should consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution will happen across each line, without reference to the previous or subsequent lines.\nTo cause wrapping behavior add the property flex-wrap\nwith a value of wrap\n. Now, if your items are too large to all display in one line, they will wrap onto another line. The live sample below contains items that have been given a width\n. The total width of the items is too wide for the flex container. As flex-wrap\nis set to wrap\n, the items wrap across multiple lines. If you set it to nowrap\n, which is the initial value, they will shrink to fit the container. They shrink because they are using initial flexbox values, including flex-shrink: 1\n, that allows items to shrink. Using nowrap\nwould cause an overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit.\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div>One</div>\n<div>Two</div>\n<div>Three</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\nwidth: 200px;\n}\n.box {\nwidth: 500px;\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-wrap: wrap;\n}\nFind out more about wrapping flex items in the guide Mastering wrapping of flex items.\nThe flex-flow shorthand\nYou can combine the two properties flex-direction\nand flex-wrap\ninto the flex-flow\nshorthand.\nIn the live sample below, try changing the first value to one of the allowable values for flex-direction\n- row\n, row-reverse\n, column\nor column-reverse\n, and also change the second to wrap\nand nowrap\n.\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div>One</div>\n<div>Two</div>\n<div>Three</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\nwidth: 200px;\n}\n.box {\nwidth: 500px;\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-flow: row wrap;\n}\nProperties applied to flex items\nTo control the inline-size of each flex item, we target them directly via three properties:\nWe will take a brief look at these properties below, but if you want more comprehensive information, take a look at the Controlling ratios of flex items on the main axis guide.\nBefore we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of available space. What we are doing when we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.\nIf we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don't change the initial values then flexbox will put that space after the last item.\nIf we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between the items. The flex\nproperties that we apply to the items themselves, enable dictating how that available space should be distributed among the sibling flex items.\nThe flex-basis property\nThe flex-basis\nis what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The initial value of this property is auto\nâ in this case the browser looks to see if the item has a size. In the example above, all of the items have a width of 100 pixels. This is used as the flex-basis\n.\nIf the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare display: flex\non the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.\nThe flex-grow property\nWith the flex-grow\nproperty set to a positive integer, if there is available space, the flex item can grow along the main axis from its flex-basis\n. Whether the item stretches to take up all the available space on that axis, or just a portion of the available space depends on if the other items are allowed to grow too and the value of their flex-grow\nproperties.\nEach item with a positive value consumes a portion of any available space based on their flex-grow\nvalue. If we gave all of our items in the example above a flex-grow\nvalue of 1 then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis. If we give our first item a flex-grow\nvalue of 2, and the other items a value of 1 each, there are a total of 4 parts; 2 parts of the available space will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above) and 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).\nThe flex-shrink property\nWhere the flex-grow\nproperty deals with adding space in the main axis, the flex-shrink\nproperty controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and flex-shrink\nis set to a positive integer, then the item can become smaller than the flex-basis\n. As with flex-grow\n, different values can be assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others â an item with a higher value set for flex-shrink\nwill shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.\nAn item can shrink down to its min-content\nsize. This minimum size is taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which means that flex-shrink\nhas the potential to appear less consistent than flex-grow\nin behavior. We'll therefore take a more detailed look at how this algorithm works in the article Controlling ratios of items along the main axis.\nNote:\nThese values for flex-grow\nand flex-shrink\nare proportions. Typically if we had all of our items set to flex: 1 1 200px\nand then wanted one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to flex: 2 1 200px\n. However you could also use flex: 10 1 200px\nand flex: 20 1 200px\nif you wanted.\nShorthand values for the flex properties\nYou will very rarely see the flex-grow\n, flex-shrink\n, and flex-basis\nproperties used individually; instead they are combined into the flex\nshorthand. The flex\nshorthand allows you to set the three values in this order â flex-grow\n, flex-shrink\n, flex-basis\n.\nThe live sample below allows you to test out the different values of the flex shorthand; remember that the first value is flex-grow\n. Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is flex-shrink\nâ with a positive value the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is flex-basis\n; this is the value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div class=\"one\">One</div>\n<div class=\"two\">Two</div>\n<div class=\"three\">Three</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n.box {\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\n}\n.one {\nflex: 1 1 auto;\n}\n.two {\nflex: 1 1 auto;\n}\n.three {\nflex: 1 1 auto;\n}\nThere are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You will often see these used in tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values are as follows:\nflex: initial\nflex: auto\nflex: none\nflex: <positive-number>\nThe initial\nvalue is a CSS-wide keyword that represents the initial value for a property. Setting flex: initial\nresets the item to the initial values of the three longhand properties, which is the same as flex: 0 1 auto\n. The initial value of flex-grow\nis 0\n, so items will not grow larger than their flex-basis\nsize. The initial value of flex-shrink\nis 1\n, so items can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The initial value of flex-basis\nis auto\n. Items will either use any size set on the item in the main dimension, or they will get their size from the content size.\nUsing flex: auto\nis the same as using flex: 1 1 auto\n; this is similar to flex: initial\n, except that the items can grow and fill the container as well as shrink if needed.\nUsing flex: none\nwill create fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you wrote flex: 0 0 auto\n. The items cannot grow or shrink and will be laid out using flexbox with a flex-basis\nof auto\n.\nThe shorthand you often see in tutorials is flex: 1\nor flex: 2\nand so on. This is the same as writing flex: 1 1 0\nor flex: 2 1 0\nand so on, respectively. The items get minimum size due to flex-basis: 0\nand then proportionally grow to fill the available space. In this case, the flex-shrink\nvalue of 1\nis redundant because the items start with minimum size â they're not given any size that could cause them to overflow the flex container.\nTry these shorthand values in the live sample below.\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div class=\"one\">One</div>\n<div class=\"two\">Two</div>\n<div class=\"three\">Three</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n.box {\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\n}\n.one {\nflex: 1;\n}\n.two {\nflex: 1;\n}\n.three {\nflex: 1;\n}\nAlignment, justification and distribution of free space between items\nA key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex items. Note that these properties are set on the flex container, not on the items themselves.\nalign-items\nThe align-items\nproperty aligns all the flex items on the cross axis.\nThe initial value for this property is stretch\nand is why flex items stretch to the height of the flex container by default (or the width if flex-direction\nis set to column\nor column-reverse\n). This height may come from the tallest item in the container or the size set on the flex container itself.\nYou could instead set align-items\nto flex-start\n, or simply start\n, in order to make the items line up at the start of the flex container, flex-end\n, or just end\n, to align them to the end, or center\nto align them in the center. Try this in the live sample â I have given the flex container a height in order that you can see how the items can be moved around inside the container. See what happens if you set the value of align-items to:\nstretch\nflex-start\nflex-end\nstart\nend\ncenter\nbaseline\nlast baseline\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div>One</div>\n<div>Two</div>\n<div>Three <br />has <br />extra <br />text</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n.box {\nwidth: 500px;\nheight: 130px;\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: flex-start;\n}\nThe align-items\nis set on the flex container and impacts all the flex items. If you want to align a flex item differently from others, you can set the align-self\non the flex item.\njustify-content\nThe justify-content\nproperty is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction in which flex-direction\nhas set the flow. The initial value is flex-start\nwhich will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to flex-end\nto line them up at the end, or center\nto line them up in the center.\nYou can also use the value space-between\nto take all the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right and left (or top and bottom for columns) of each item use the value space-around\n. With space-around\n, items have a half-size space on either end. Or, to cause items to have equal space around them use the value space-evenly\n. With space-evenly\n, items have a full-size space on either end.\nTry the following values of justify-content\nin the live sample:\nstart\nend\nleft\nright\nnormal\nflex-start\nflex-end\ncenter\nspace-around\nspace-between\nspace-evenly\nstretch\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div>One</div>\n<div>Two</div>\n<div>Three</div>\n</div>\n.box > * {\nborder: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nbackground-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n.box {\nborder: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: flex-start;\n}\nThe article Aligning items in a flex container explores these properties in more depth, in order to have a better understanding of how they work. These basic examples, however, are useful in the majority of use cases.\njustify-items\nThe justify-items\nproperty is ignored in flexbox layouts.\nplace-items and place-content\nThe place-items\nproperty is a shorthand property for align-items\nand justify-items\n. If set on a flex container, it will set the alignment but not the justification, as justify-items\nis ignored in flexbox.\nThere is another shorthand property, place-content\n, that defines the align-content\nand justify-content\nproperties. The align-content\nproperty only affects flex containers that wrap, and is discussed in Aligning items in a flex container.\nNext steps\nAfter reading this article you should have an understanding of the basic features of flexbox. In the next article, we will look at how this specification relates to other parts of CSS."}
{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Colors/Applying_color", "title": "Applying color to HTML elements using CSS - CSS | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Applying color to HTML elements using CSS\nWith CSS, there are lots of ways to add color to your HTML elements to create the look you want. This guide is a primer introducing how CSS can be used to apply colors to HTML elements. This guide includes lists of the CSS properties that set color in their values and how to use colors both in stylesheets and in other ways.\nNote: It is important to use colors wisely. Always select appropriate colors, ensuring the contrast between text and the background is sufficient to ensure legibility, and always keep the needs of people with differing visual capabilities in mind.\nTo learn more about CSS colors as a data type, see the CSS <color>\ndata type reference and the CSS color values guide.\nProperties that can have color\nAt the element level, everything in HTML can have color applied to it. Let's look at the different items rendered on the page â such as text, borders, etc. We'll provide lists of the CSS properties that apply color to each.\nAt a fundamental level, the color\nproperty defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content and the background-color\nproperty defines the element's background color. These can be used on just about any element.\nText\nWhenever an element is rendered, these properties are used to determine the color of the text, its background, and any decorations on the text.\ncolor\n-\nThe color to use when drawing the text and any text decorations (such as the addition of under- or overlines, strike-through lines, and so forth.\nbackground-color\n-\nThe text's background color.\ntext-shadow\n-\nConfigures a shadow effect to apply to text. Among the options for the shadow is the shadow's base color (which is then blurred and blended with the background based on the other parameters). See Text drop shadows to learn more.\ntext-decoration-color\n-\nThe default text decorations (such as underlines, strikethroughs, etc.) color is\ncurrentColor\n. This keyword represents the current value of thecolor\nproperty. However, you can override that value and use a different color for them with thetext-decoration-color\nproperty. text-emphasis-color\n-\nThe color to use when rendering emphasis symbols adjacent to each character in the text. This is used primarily when drawing text for East Asian languages.\ncaret-color\n-\nThe color to use when drawing the caret (sometimes referred to as the text input cursor) within the element. This is only useful in elements that are editable, such as\n<input>\nand<textarea>\nor elements whose HTMLcontenteditable\nattribute is set totrue\n.\nBoxes\nEvery element is a box with some sort of content, and has a background and a border in addition to whatever contents the box may have.\n- Borders\n-\nSee the Borders section for a list of the CSS properties you can use to set the colors of a box's borders.\nbackground-color\n-\nThe background color to use in areas of the element that have no foreground content.\nbox-shadow\n-\nConfigures inset shadow and drop shadow effects on the box. Among the options for each shadow is the shadow's base color (which is then blurred and blended with any background based on the other parameters).\ncolumn-rule-color\n-\nThe color to use when drawing the line separating columns of text when using CSS multi-column layout.\noutline-color\n-\nThe color to use when drawing an outline around the outside of the element. This outline is different from the border in that it doesn't get space set aside for it in the document. Outlines do not participate in the box model, overlapping other content. Outlines are generally used as focus indicators, indicating which element currently has focus and will receive keyboard input events.\nBorders\nAny element can have a border drawn around it. A basic element border is a line drawn around the edges of the element's content. See The box model to learn about the relationship between elements and their borders, and the article Styling borders using CSS to learn more about applying styles to borders.\nYou can use the border\nshorthand property, which lets you configure everything about the border in one shot (including non-color features of borders, such as its width, style (solid, dashed, etc.), and so forth.\nborder-color\nshorthand-\nSpecifies a single color to use for every side of the element's border.\nborder-left-color\n,border-right-color\n,border-top-color\n, andborder-bottom-color\n-\nLets you set the color of the corresponding side of the element's border.\nborder-block-start-color\nandborder-block-end-color\n-\nWith these, you can set the color used to draw the borders which are closest to the start and end of the block the border surrounds. In a left-to-right writing mode (such as the way English is written), the block start border is the top edge and the block end is the bottom. This differs from the inline start and end, which are the left and right edges (corresponding to where each line of text in the box begins and ends).\nborder-inline-start-color\nandborder-inline-end-color\n-\nThese let you color the edges of the border closest to the beginning and the end of the start of lines of text within the box. Which side this is will vary depending on the\nwriting-mode\n,direction\n, andtext-orientation\nproperties, which are typically (but not always) used to adjust text directionality based on the language being displayed. For example, if the box's text is being rendered right-to-left, then theborder-inline-start-color\nis applied to the right side of the border.\nSpecifying colors as values in stylesheets\nNow that you know which CSS properties let you apply color to elements, you can start adding colors to your websites. Let's look at some examples of using color within a stylesheet. In this example, we use several previously mentioned properties, with the concept of applying colors in CSS being the same no matter the property.\nLet's look at the result first, before going on to look at the code we need to create it:\nHTML\nThe HTML responsible for creating the above example is shown here:\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<div class=\"boxLeft\">\n<p>This is the first box.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"boxRight\">\n<p>This is the second box.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\nHere we have a wrapper <div>\ncontaining two child <div>\ns, each with a single child paragraph (<p>\n). Each content <div>\nis given a different look and feel.\nCSS\nLet's look at the CSS that creates the above result a piece at a time.\nNote: We are using multiple different CSS color value types in this example to demonstrate their use. This is not recommended for production code. When writing CSS, use the most intuitive value type for you and your team.\n.wrapper {\nheight: 110px;\npadding: 10px;\ndisplay: flex;\ngap: 10px;\ntext-align: center;\nfont:\n28px \"Marker Felt\",\n\"Zapfino\",\ncursive;\nborder: 6px solid mediumturquoise;\n}\ndiv {\nflex: 1;\n}\nThe .wrapper\nclass is used to assign styles to the <div>\nthat encloses all of our other content. This establishes the height of the container using height\n, allowing the width of this block-level element to default to 100% of its parent. Setting the display\nto flex\nand adding a 10px\ngap\ncreates a flex container to lay out the children side by side with a gap between all the container's children. We use flex\nto let the flex children grow to fill the container; it doesn't effect the flex container itself.\nOf more interest to our discussion here is the use of the border\nproperty to establish a border around the outside edge of the element. This border is a solid line, 6 pixels wide, in the named color mediumturquoise\n.\nWithin our wrapper, we have a left box and a right box.\n.boxLeft {\nbackground-color: rgb(245 130 130);\noutline: 2px solid darkred;\n}\nThe .boxLeft\nclass, used to style the box on the left, sets up the color of the background and the outline:\n- The box's background color is set by changing the value of the CSS\nbackground-color\nproperty torgb(245 130 130)\n, using thergb()\nfunctional notation. - An outline is defined for the box. Unlike the more commonly used\nborder\n,outline\ndoesn't affect layout at all; it draws over the top of whatever may happen to be outside the element's box instead of making room asborder\ndoes. This outline is a solid, dark red line that's two pixels thick. Note the use of thedarkred\nkeyword when specifying the color. - Notice that we're not explicitly setting the text color. That means the value of\ncolor\nwill be inherited from the nearest containing element that defines it. By default, that's black.\n.boxRight {\nbackground-color: hwb(270deg 63% 13%);\noutline: 4px dashed #6e1478;\ncolor: hsl(0deg 95% 95%);\ntext-decoration-line: underline;\ntext-decoration-style: wavy;\ntext-decoration-color: #8f8;\ntext-decoration: underline wavy #8f8;\ntext-shadow: 2px 2px 3px black;\n}\nNote:\nWe included the text-decoration-*\nstyles separately because Safari doesn't support text-decoration\nas a shorthand property.\nFinally, the .boxRight\nclass sets several styles on the box that's drawn to the right. Then the following colors are established (using five different ways of declaring color values):\n- The\nbackground-color\nis set usinghwb()\nfunctional notation âhwb(270deg 63% 13%)\n. This is a medium purple color. - The box's\noutline\nis used to specify that the box should be enclosed in a four-pixel thick dashed line whose color is a somewhat deeper purple using the six-digit<hex-color>\n#6e1478\n. - The foreground (text) color is specified by setting the\ncolor\nproperty usinghsl()\nfunctional notation âhsl(0deg 95% 95%)\n. This is a very light pinkish color. - We add a green wavy line under the text with the\ntext-decoration\nshorthand, along with the longhand component for browser compatibility. We used the 3-digit<hex-color>\n#8f8\n, which is the equivalent of#88ff88\n. - Finally, a bit of a shadow is added to the text using\ntext-shadow\n. Itscolor\nparameter is set toblack\n, a<named-color>\nvalue.\nWe used five different color syntaxes to demonstrate what is possible. In the real world, you and your team will preferably pick a preferred color notation, with everyone working on a code base using the same color syntax.\nOther ways to use color\nCSS isn't the only web technology that supports color. Other examples include:\n- The HTML Canvas API\n-\nLets you draw 2D bitmapped graphics in a\n<canvas>\nelement. See our Canvas tutorial to learn more. - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)\n-\nLets you create images using commands that draw specific shapes, patterns, and lines. SVG commands are formatted as XML, and can be embedded directly into a web page or placed in the page using the\n<img>\nelement, just like any other type of image. - WebGL\n-\nThe Web Graphics Library is an OpenGL ES-based API for drawing high-performance 2D and 3D graphics on the Web. See our WebGL tutorial to find out more. Also see WebGPU, a successor to WebGL for modern GPUs.\nNote:\nA few now obsolete HTML attributes accepted colors as values, such as bgcolor\nand vlink\n. These attributes only accepted <named-color>\nand three- or six-digit <hex-color>\nvalues.\nSee also\n<color>\ndata type- CSS color values guide\n- Using color wisely\n- CSS color module\n- Drawing graphics"}

Each module landing page provides an overview of the specification, lists the features it provides (such as properties, at-rules, and data types), and shows how they relate to other parts of CSS and the web platform. You can use the module pages as a starting point to navigate through the related guides and dive deeper into reference documentation for specific features.\nTo access the individual guides within each module, click on a module name from the following list to visit its landing page, or use the sidebar to navigate directly to a topic and discover all related guides.\n- CSS anchor positioning\nThe CSS anchor positioning module defines features that allow you to tether elements together. Certain elements are defined as anchor elements; anchor-positioned elements can then have their size and position set based on the size and location of the anchor elements to which they are bound.\n- CSS animations\nThe CSS animations module lets you animate the values of CSS properties, such as background-position and transform, over time by using keyframes. Each keyframe describes how the animated element should render at a given time during the animation sequence. You can use the properties in the animations module to control the duration, number of repetitions, delayed start, and other aspects of an animation.\n- CSS backgrounds and borders\nThe CSS backgrounds and borders module provides properties for adding backgrounds, borders, rounded corners, and box shadows to elements.\n- CSS basic user interface\nThe CSS basic user interface module allows you to define the rendering and functionality of features related to the user interface, including outline properties, visual feedback for pointing devices and keyboards, and modifying the default appearance of UI widgets.\n- CSS borders and box decorations\nThe CSS borders and box decorations module provides properties for adding borders, shaped corners, and box shadows to elements. This module extends borders and box decorations introduced in the CSS backgrounds and borders module, adding\ncorner-shape\nandborder-shape\nproperties, logicalborder-radius\nproperties, longhand properties for thebox-shadow\nproperty, and properties to create partial borders.- CSS box alignment\nThe CSS box alignment module specifies CSS features relating to the alignment of boxes within their containers. It defines the alignment of the various CSS box layout models including block layout, table layout, flexible box layout (flexbox), and grid layout, creating a consistent alignment method across all of CSS.\n- CSS box model\nThe CSS box model module defines the\nmargin\nandpadding\nproperties, which along with the height, width and border properties, make up the CSS box model.- CSS box sizing\nThe CSS box sizing module enables you to specify how elements fit their content or fit into a particular layout context. It defines sizing, minimum sizing, and maximum sizing properties, and also extends the CSS sizing properties with keywords that represent content-based intrinsic size and context-based extrinsic size.\n- CSS cascading and inheritance\nThe CSS cascading and inheritance module defines the rules for assigning values to properties by way of cascading and inheritance. This module specifies the rules for finding the specified value for all properties on all elements.\n- CSS color adjustment\nThe CSS color adjustment module provides a model and controls automatic color adjustment by the user agent to handle user preferences, such as \"Dark Mode\", contrast adjustment, and other color scheme preferences.\n- CSS colors\nThe CSS colors module defines colors, color types, color blending, opacity, and how you can apply these colors and effects to HTML content.\n- CSS compositing and blending\nThe CSS compositing and blending module defines how an element's background layers can be blended together, how an element can be blended with its container, and whether the element must create a new stacking context.\n- CSS conditional rules\nThe CSS conditional rules module defines CSS media and support queries, enabling you to define styles that are only applied if specific conditions are met. The conditional rules defined in this module are based on device, user-agent, and viewport capabilities. With conditional rules, you can target CSS styles based on query values or browser and device features, independent of the document being rendered.\n- CSS containment\nThe CSS containment module defines containment and container queries.\n- CSS counter styles\nThe CSS counter styles module lets you define your own counter styles to manage the appearance of markers in lists and counters in generated content. It also enables you to extend native browser list styles with your own customizations.\n- CSS custom functions and mixins\nThe CSS custom functions and mixins module allows developers to create reusable blocks of CSS code that can accept arguments, contain complex logic (defined using features such as CSS\nif()\nfunctions and@media\nat-rules), and return values based on that logic.- CSS custom highlight API\nThe CSS custom highlight API module provides a programmatic way to target specific ranges of text defined by range objects, without affecting the underlying DOM structure. The range objects can then be selected via\n::highlight()\npseudo-elements, and have highlight styles added and removed. The features of this module can create highlight effects similar to how text editors highlight spelling or grammar errors, and code editors highlight syntax errors.- CSS custom properties for cascading variables\nThe CSS custom properties for cascading variables module adds support for cascading variables in CSS properties and lets you create custom properties to define these variables along with the mechanisms to use custom properties as the values for other CSS properties.\n- CSS display\nThe CSS display module defines how the CSS formatting box tree is generated from the document element tree and defines properties controlling it.\n- CSS easing functions\nThe CSS easing functions module defines easing functions, which provide a means to control the transformation of values. The functions defined include linear, cubic bezier, and step easing functions. These easing functions can be applied to animations and transitions.\n- CSS environment variables\nThe CSS environment variables module defines the concept of environment variables and the\nenv\nfunction. Environment variables work similarly to custom properties and thevar\nfunction, except that they are globally defined; they are global variables scoped to the entire document. They are user agent values, provided by the browser or operating system, you can access using theenv\nfunction enabling you to adapt your styles to the user's device or context.- CSS filter effects\nThe properties in the CSS filter effects module let you define a way of processing an element's rendering before the element is displayed in the document. Examples of such effects include blurring and changing the intensity of the color of an element.\n- CSS flexible box layout\nThe CSS flexible box layout module defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can \"flex\" their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated.\n- CSS font loading\nThe CSS font loading module describes events and interfaces used for dynamically loading font resources.\n- CSS fonts\nThe CSS fonts module defines font-related properties and how font resources are loaded. It lets you define the style of a font, such as its family, size and weight, and the glyph variants to use when multiple are available for a single character.\n- CSS fragmentation\nThe CSS fragmentation module defines how content is displayed when it is broken (fragmented) and flows across multiple pages, regions, or columns. This module defines features for pagination, breaking variable fragment size and orientation, widows and orphans.\n- CSS generated content\nThe CSS generated content module defines how an element's content can be replaced and content can be added to a document with CSS.\n- CSS grid layout\nThe CSS grid layout module excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layering between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.\n- CSS images\nThe CSS images module defines the types of images that can be used (the\nimage\ntype, containing URLs, gradients and other types of images), how to resize them and how they, and other replaced content, interact with the different layout models.- CSS inline layout\nThe CSS inline layout module defines the block-axis alignment and sizing of inline-level content and adds a special layout mode for drop-caps. It describes the CSS formatting model for a flow of elements and text inside a container to be wrapped across multiple lines.\n- CSS lists and counters\nThe CSS lists and counters module enables styling and positioning of list item bullets and manipulating their values with a combination of strings, counters, and other features.\n- CSS logical properties and values\nThe CSS logical properties and values module defines logical properties and values that can control layout through logical rather than physical direction and dimension mappings. Logical properties define directionârelative equivalents to their corresponding physical properties.\n- CSS masking\nThe CSS masking module defines masking and clipping, two different graphical operations that are used to partially or fully hide portions of visual elements.\n- CSS media queries\nThe CSS media queries module enables testing and querying of viewport values and browser or device features, to conditionally apply CSS styles based on the current user environment. Media queries are used in the CSS\n@media\nrule and other contexts and languages such as HTML and JavaScript.- CSS motion path\nThe CSS motion path module allows authors to animate any graphical object along a custom path.\n- CSS multi-column layout\nThe CSS multi-column layout module lets you divide content across multiple columns. By using the properties in this module, you can define the preferred number and width of columns, the gap size between columns, and the visual appearance of the optional column dividing lines (known as column rules). You can also define how content should flow from column to column and how to break content between columns.\n- CSS namespaces\nThe CSS namespaces module defines the syntax for using namespaces in CSS.\n- CSS nesting\nThe CSS nesting module defines a syntax for nesting selectors, providing the ability to nest one style rule inside another, with the selector of the child rule relative to the selector of the parent rule.\n- CSS overflow\nThe CSS overflow module properties enable you to handle scrollable overflow in visual media.\n- CSS overscroll behavior\nThe CSS overscroll behavior module provides properties to control the behavior of a scroll container when its scroll position reaches the scroll boundary. Controlling this aspect is particularly useful in scenarios where embedded scrollable areas should not trigger scrolling of the parent container.\n- CSS paged media\nThe CSS paged media module defines the properties that control the presentation of content for print or any other media that splits content into discrete pages. It allows you to set page breaks, control printable areas, and style left and right pages differently.\n- CSS positioned layout\nThe CSS positioned layout module defines the coordinate-based positioning and offsetting schemes available in CSS and the properties used to position and stack elements on a web page. The module is best known for defining the basic positioning methods, including relative positioning, sticky positioning, absolute positioning, and fixed positioning. It also defines how positioned elements are painted and layered, clarifying stacking behavior and visual order.\n- CSS properties and values API\nThe CSS properties and values API module defines a method for registering new CSS properties, defining the property's data type, inheritance behavior, and, optionally, an initial value. This API expands on CSS custom properties for cascading variables module, which allows authors to define custom properties in CSS using two dash syntax (\n--\n). The CSS properties and values API is part of the CSS Houdini umbrella of APIs.- CSS pseudo-elements\nThe CSS pseudo-element module defines abstract elements that are not directly present in the document tree. These abstract elements, called pseudo-elements, represent portions of the render tree that can be selected and styled. Pseudo-elements are used to create abstractions about the document tree beyond those provided by the document tree.\n- CSS round display\nThe CSS round display module defines CSS extensions to support a round display, such as wrist-watches, to help developers build web pages suitable for those devices.\n- CSS ruby layout\nThe CSS ruby layout module provides the rendering model and formatting controls related to the display of ruby annotations. Ruby annotations are a form of interlinear annotation, consisting of short runs of text alongside the base text. They are typically used in East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or define meaning.\n- CSS scoping\nThe CSS scoping module defines the CSS scoping and encapsulation mechanisms, focusing on the Shadow DOM scoping mechanism.\n- CSS scroll anchoring\nThe CSS scroll anchoring module defines a mechanism to prevent page movement due to DOM changes above the visible region of a scrolling box while the user is consuming the visible content.\n- CSS scroll snap\nThe CSS scroll snap module provides properties that let you control the panning and scrolling behavior by defining snap positions. Content can be snapped into position as the user scrolls overflowing content within a scroll container, providing paging and scroll positioning.\n- CSS scroll-driven animations\nThe CSS scroll-driven animations module provides functionality that builds on the CSS animations module and Web Animations API. It allows you to animate property values along a scroll-based timeline rather than the default time-based document timeline. This means that you can animate an element by scrolling the element, its scroll container, or its root element, rather than just by the passing of time.\n- CSS scrollbars styling\nThe CSS scrollbars styling module defines properties that you can use for visual styling of scrollbars. You can customize the width of the scrollbar as required. You can also customize the color of the scrollbar track, which is the background of the scrollbar, and the color of the scrollbar thumb, which is the draggable handle of the scrollbar.\n- CSS selectors\nThe CSS selectors module defines the patterns to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then applied along with their specificity. The CSS selectors module provides us with more than 60 selectors and five combinators. Other modules provide additional pseudo-class selectors and pseudo-elements.\n- CSS shadow parts\nThe CSS shadow parts module defines the\n::part()\npseudo-element that can be set on a shadow host. Using this pseudo-element, you can enable shadow hosts to expose the selected element in the shadow tree to the outside page for styling purposes.- CSS shapes\nThe CSS shapes module describes geometric shapes. It also defines CSS properties that can use the shapes to control the geometry of an element's float area; this area can then be applied to exclusions, or specify an element's content area.\n- CSS syntax\nThe CSS syntax module describes, in general terms, the structure and syntax of cascading stylesheets, or CSS. It defines CSS as the language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML), on the web and elsewhere.\n- CSS table\nThe CSS table module helps you define how to lay out table data.\n- CSS text\nThe CSS text module defines how to perform text manipulation, like line breaking, justification and alignment, white space handling, and text transformation.\n- CSS text decoration\nThe CSS text decoration module defines features relating to text decoration, such as underlines, text shadows, and emphasis marks. Text decoration features can provide visual cues for spelling errors, grammar issues, and links. These features can help improve the usability, accessibility, functionality, and aesthetics of your text.\n- CSS transforms\nThe CSS transforms module defines how elements styled with CSS can be transformed in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space.\n- CSS transitions\nThe CSS transitions module specifies functionality for creating gradual transitions between different CSS property values. The behavior of these transitions can be controlled by specifying their easing function, duration, and other values.\n- CSS values and units\nEvery CSS declaration consists of a property/value pair. The value can take various forms depending on the property, such as a single integer, keyword, function, or a combination of different items; some values have units, while others do not. Every property also accepts the CSS-wide values. The CSS values and units module defines the data types â values and units â that CSS properties accept.

Just adding this one property turns all the children (child elements, pseudo-elements, and text nodes) into flex items along a single line. Setting the same flex\nshorthand property with a single numeric value distributes all the available space equally, generally making all the flex items the same size as long as none have non-wrapping content forcing the item to be larger.\nMargins or the gap\nproperty can be used to create gaps between items, but there is currently no CSS property that adds rules between flex items.\n<div class=\"container\">\n<p>\nVeggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion\ndaikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.\n</p>\n<p>\nGumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd.

Note that each flex line distributes space for that line only. Items in one line will not necessarily line up with items on other lines, as you'll see in the example below. This is why flexbox is described as one-dimensional. It is designed for controlling layout as a row or a column, but not both at the same time.\n<div class=\"container\">\n<p>\nVeggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion\ndaikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.\n</p>\n<p>\nGumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd.

Similar to how flexbox works on the direct children of the flex container, grid layout works on the direct children of the grid container. Just set display: grid;\non the container. Properties set on this container â like grid-template-columns\nand grid-template-rows\nâ define how the items are distributed along rows and columns.\nClick \"Play\" in the code blocks below to edit the example in the MDN Playground:\n<div class=\"container\">\n<p>\nVeggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion\ndaikon amaranth tatsoi.\n</p>\n<p>\nGumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd.

This enables the use of content sizing for the grid tracks. To set up a single-column grid we can use the following:\n.card {\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-rows: max-content 200px 1fr;\n}\ndisplay: grid\nconverts the element into a grid container. The three values of the grid-template-rows\nproperty divide the grid into a minimum of three rows, defining the height of the first three children of the card, in order.\nEach card\ncontains a <header>\n, <img>\n, and <div>\n, in that order, with some also containing a <footer>\n.\nThe heading row, or track, is set to max-content\n, which prevents it from stretching. The image track is set to 200 pixels tall. The third track, where the content lives, is set to 1fr\n. This means it will fill any additional space.\nAny children beyond the three with explicitly defined sizes create rows in the implicit grid, which fits the content added to it. These are auto-sized by default. If a card contains a footer, it is auto-sized. The footer, when present, sticks to the bottom of the grid. The footer is auto-sized to fit its content; the content <div>\nthen stretches take up any additional space.\nThe following ruleset creates the grid of cards:\n.cards {\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(230px, 1fr));\ngap: 20px;\n}\nThe grid-template-columns\nproperty defines the widths of the grid columns. In this case, we set the grid to auto-fill, with repeated columns that are minimally 230px\nbut allowed to grow to fill the available space. The gap\nproperty sets a gap of 20px\nbetween adjacent rows and adjacent columns.\nNote: The various elements in separate cards do not align with each other, as each card is an independent grid. Lining up the components in each card with the same components in adjacent cards can be done with subgrid.\nAlternative methods\nFlexbox can also be used to lay out each card. With flexbox, the dimensions of each card's rows are set with the flex\nproperty on each row, rather than on the card container.\nWith flexbox, the dimensions of the flex items are defined on the children rather than the parent. Whether you choose to use grid or flexbox depends on your preference, whether you prefer controlling the tracks from the container or prefer adding rules to the items.\nWe chose grid for the cards as, generally, you want cards to be lined up both vertically and horizontally. Additionally, lining up the components within each card to the components of adjacent cards can be done with subgrid. Flex has no hack-free equivalent to subgrid.\nAccessibility concerns\nDepending on the content of your card, there may be things you could or should do to enhance accessibility. See Inclusive components: Card by Heydon Pickering, for a very detailed explanation of these issues."}

While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, garbage-collected, dynamic language, supporting multiple paradigms such as imperative, functional, and object-oriented.\nJavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval\n), object introspection (via for...in\nand Object\nutilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()\n).\nThis section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.\nThe standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.\nDo not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â JavaScript is not \"Interpreted Java\".

They are two disjoint sets of grammars. The following are declarations:\nlet\nconst\nfunction\nfunction*\nasync function\nasync function*\nclass\nexport\n(Note: it can only appear at the top-level of a module)import\n(Note: it can only appear at the top-level of a module)\nEverything else in the list above is a statement.\nThe terms \"statement\" and \"declaration\" have a precise meaning in the formal syntax of JavaScript that affects where they may be placed in code. For example, in most control-flow structures, the body only accepts statements â such as the two arms of an if...else\n:\nif (condition)\nstatement1;\nelse\nstatement2;\nIf you use a declaration instead of a statement, it would be a SyntaxError\n. For example, a let\ndeclaration is not a statement, so you can't use it in its bare form as the body of an if\nstatement.\nif (condition)\nlet i = 0; // SyntaxError: Lexical declaration cannot appear in a single-statement context\nOn the other hand, var\nis a statement, so you can use it on its own as the if\nbody.\nif (condition)\nvar i = 0;\nYou can see declarations as \"binding identifiers to values\", and statements as \"carrying out actions\". The fact that var\nis a statement instead of a declaration is a special case, because it doesn't follow normal lexical scoping rules and may create side effects â in the form of creating global variables, mutating existing var\n-defined variables, and defining variables that are visible outside of its block (because var\n-defined variables aren't block-scoped).\nAs another example, labels can only be attached to statements.\nlabel: const a = 1; // SyntaxError: Lexical declaration cannot appear in a single-statement context\nNote: There's a legacy grammar that allows function declarations to have labels, but it's only standardized for compatibility with web reality.\nTo get around this, you can wrap the declaration in braces â this makes it part of a block statement.\nlabel: {\nconst a = 1;\n}\nif (condition) {\nlet i = 0;\n}"}
{"url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions", "title": "Functions - JavaScript | MDN", "domain": "developer.mozilla.org", "text": "Functions\nBaseline\nWidely available\n*\nThis feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. Itâs been available across browsers since â¨July 2015â©.\n* Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support.\nGenerally speaking, a function is a \"subprogram\" that can be called by code external (or internal, in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function as parameters, and the function will return a value.\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can be passed to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties. They can also have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called.\nFor more examples and explanations, see the JavaScript guide about functions.\nDescription\nFunction values are typically instances of Function\n. See Function\nfor information on properties and methods of Function\nobjects. Callable values cause typeof\nto return \"function\"\ninstead of \"object\"\n.\nNote:\nNot all callable values are instanceof Function\n. For example, the Function.prototype\nobject is callable but not an instance of Function\n. You can also manually set the prototype chain of your function so it no longer inherits from Function.prototype\n. However, such cases are extremely rare.\nReturn value\nBy default, if a function's execution doesn't end at a return\nstatement, or if the return\nkeyword doesn't have an expression after it, then the return value is undefined\n. The return\nstatement allows you to return an arbitrary value from the function. One function call can only return one value, but you can simulate the effect of returning multiple values by returning an object or array and destructuring the result.\nNote:\nConstructors called with new\nhave a different set of logic to determine their return values.\nPassing arguments\nParameters and arguments have slightly different meanings, but in MDN web docs, we often use them interchangeably. For a quick reference:\nfunction formatNumber(num) {\nreturn num.toFixed(2);\n}\nformatNumber(2);\nIn this example, the num\nvariable is called the function's parameter: it's declared in the parenthesis-enclosed list of the function's definition. The function expects the num\nparameter to be a number â although this is not enforceable in JavaScript without writing runtime validation code. In the formatNumber(2)\ncall, the number 2\nis the function's argument: it's the value that is actually passed to the function in the function call. The argument value can be accessed inside the function body through the corresponding parameter name or the arguments\nobject.\nArguments are always passed by value and never passed by reference. This means that if a function reassigns a parameter, the value won't change outside the function. More precisely, object arguments are passed by sharing, which means if the object's properties are mutated, the change will impact the outside of the function. For example:\nfunction updateBrand(obj) {\n// Mutating the object is visible outside the function\nobj.brand = \"Toyota\";\n// Try to reassign the parameter, but this won't affect\n// the variable's value outside the function\nobj = null;\n}\nconst car = {\nbrand: \"Honda\",\nmodel: \"Accord\",\nyear: 1998,\n};\nconsole.log(car.brand); // Honda\n// Pass object reference to the function\nupdateBrand(car);\n// updateBrand mutates car\nconsole.log(car.brand); // Toyota\nThe this\nkeyword refers to the object that the function is accessed on â it does not refer to the currently executing function, so you must refer to the function value by name, even within the function body.\nDefining functions\nBroadly speaking, JavaScript has four kinds of functions:\n- Regular function: can return anything; always runs to completion after invocation\n- Generator function: returns a\nGenerator\nobject; can be paused and resumed with theyield\noperator - Async function: returns a\nPromise\n; can be paused and resumed with theawait\noperator - Async generator function: returns an\nAsyncGenerator\nobject; both theawait\nandyield\noperators can be used\nFor every kind of function, there are multiple ways to define it:\n- Declaration\n- Expression\n- Constructor\n-\nFunction()\n,GeneratorFunction()\n,AsyncFunction()\n,AsyncGeneratorFunction()\nIn addition, there are special syntaxes for defining arrow functions and methods, which provide more precise semantics for their usage. Classes are conceptually not functions (because they throw an error when called without new\n), but they also inherit from Function.prototype\nand have typeof MyClass === \"function\"\n.\n// Constructor\nconst multiply = new Function(\"x\", \"y\", \"return x * y\");\n// Declaration\nfunction multiply(x, y) {\nreturn x * y;\n} // No need for semicolon here\n// Expression; the function is anonymous but assigned to a variable\nconst multiply = function (x, y) {\nreturn x * y;\n};\n// Expression; the function has its own name\nconst multiply = function funcName(x, y) {\nreturn x * y;\n};\n// Arrow function\nconst multiply = (x, y) => x * y;\n// Method\nconst obj = {\nmultiply(x, y) {\nreturn x * y;\n},\n};\nAll syntaxes do approximately the same thing, but there are some subtle behavior differences.\n- The\nFunction()\nconstructor,function\nexpression, andfunction\ndeclaration syntaxes create full-fledged function objects, which can be constructed withnew\n. However, arrow functions and methods cannot be constructed. Async functions, generator functions, and async generator functions are not constructible regardless of syntax. - The\nfunction\ndeclaration creates functions that are hoisted. Other syntaxes do not hoist the function and the function value is only visible after the definition. - The arrow function and\nFunction()\nconstructor always create anonymous functions, which means they can't easily call themselves recursively. One way to call an arrow function recursively is by assigning it to a variable. - The arrow function syntax does not have access to\narguments\northis\n. - The\nFunction()\nconstructor cannot access any local variables â it only has access to the global scope. - The\nFunction()\nconstructor causes runtime compilation and is often slower than other syntaxes.\nFor function\nexpressions, there is a distinction between the function name and the variable the function is assigned to. The function name cannot be changed, while the variable the function is assigned to can be reassigned. The function name can be different from the variable the function is assigned to â they have no relation to each other. The function name can be used only within the function's body. Attempting to use it outside the function's body results in an error (or gets another value, if the same name is declared elsewhere). For example:\nconst y = function x() {};\nconsole.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined\nOn the other hand, the variable the function is assigned to is limited only by its scope, which is guaranteed to include the scope in which the function is declared.\nA function declaration also creates a variable with the same name as the function name. Thus, unlike those defined by function expressions, functions defined by function declarations can be accessed by their name in the scope they were defined in, as well as in their own body.\nA function defined by new Function\nwill dynamically have its source assembled, which is observable when you serialize it. For example, console.log(new Function().toString())\ngives:\nfunction anonymous(\n) {\n}\nThis is the actual source used to compile the function. However, although the Function()\nconstructor will create the function with name anonymous\n, this name is not added to the scope of the body. The body only ever has access to global variables. For example, the following would result in an error:\nnew Function(\"alert(anonymous);\")();\nA function defined by a function expression or by a function declaration inherits the current scope. That is, the function forms a closure. On the other hand, a function defined by a Function\nconstructor does not inherit any scope other than the global scope (which all functions inherit).\n// p is a global variable\nglobalThis.p = 5;\nfunction myFunc() {\n// p is a local variable\nconst p = 9;\nfunction decl() {\nconsole.log(p);\n}\nconst expr = function () {\nconsole.log(p);\n};\nconst cons = new Function(\"\\tconsole.log(p);\");\ndecl();\nexpr();\ncons();\n}\nmyFunc();\n// Logs:\n// 9 (for 'decl' by function declaration (current scope))\n// 9 (for 'expr' by function expression (current scope))\n// 5 (for 'cons' by Function constructor (global scope))\nFunctions defined by function expressions and function declarations are parsed only once, while a function defined by the Function\nconstructor parses the string passed to it each and every time the constructor is called. Although a function expression creates a closure every time, the function body is not reparsed, so function expressions are still faster than new Function(...)\n. Therefore the Function\nconstructor should generally be avoided whenever possible.\nA function declaration may be unintentionally turned into a function expression when it appears in an expression context.\n// A function declaration\nfunction foo() {\nconsole.log(\"FOO!\");\n}\ndoSomething(\n// A function expression passed as an argument\nfunction foo() {\nconsole.log(\"FOO!\");\n},\n);\nOn the other hand, a function expression may also be turned into a function declaration. An expression statement cannot begin with the function\nor async function\nkeywords, which is a common mistake when implementing IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).\nfunction () { // SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name\nconsole.log(\"FOO!\");\n}();\nfunction foo() {\nconsole.log(\"FOO!\");\n}(); // SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'\nInstead, start the expression statement with something else, so that the function\nkeyword unambiguously starts a function expression. Common options include grouping and using void\n.\n(function () {\nconsole.log(\"FOO!\");\n})();\nvoid function () {\nconsole.log(\"FOO!\");\n}();\nFunction parameters\nEach function parameter is a simple identifier that you can access in the local scope.\nfunction myFunc(a, b, c) {\n// You can access the values of a, b, and c here\n}\nThere are three special parameter syntaxes:\n- Default parameters allow formal parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or\nundefined\nis passed. - The rest parameter allows representing an indefinite number of arguments as an array.\n- Destructuring allows unpacking elements from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.\nfunction myFunc({ a, b }, c = 1, ...rest) {\n// You can access the values of a, b, c, and rest here\n}\nThere are some consequences if one of the above non-simple parameter syntaxes is used:\n- You cannot apply\n\"use strict\"\nto the function body â this causes a syntax error. - Even if the function is not in strict mode, certain strict mode function features apply, including that the\narguments\nobject stops syncing with the named parameters,arguments.callee\nthrows an error when accessed, and duplicate parameter names are not allowed.\nThe arguments object\nYou can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the arguments\nobject.\narguments\n-\nAn array-like object containing the arguments passed to the currently executing function.\narguments.callee\n-\nThe currently executing function.\narguments.length\n-\nThe number of arguments passed to the function.\nGetter and setter functions\nYou can define accessor properties on any standard built-in object or user-defined object that supports the addition of new properties. Within object literals and classes, you can use special syntaxes to define the getter and setter of an accessor property.\n- get\n-\nBinds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up.\n- set\n-\nBinds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property.\nNote that these syntaxes create an object property, not a method. The getter and setter functions themselves can only be accessed using reflective APIs such as Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()\n.\nBlock-level functions\nIn strict mode, functions inside blocks are scoped to that block. Prior to ES2015, block-level functions were forbidden in strict mode.\n\"use strict\";\nfunction f() {\nreturn 1;\n}\n{\nfunction f() {\nreturn 2;\n}\n}\nf() === 1; // true\n// f() === 2 in non-strict mode\nBlock-level functions in non-strict code\nIn a word: Don't.\nIn non-strict code, function declarations inside blocks behave strangely. For example:\nif (shouldDefineZero) {\nfunction zero() {\n// DANGER: compatibility risk\nconsole.log(\"This is zero.\");\n}\n}\nThe semantics of this in strict mode are well-specified â zero\nonly ever exists within that scope of the if\nblock. If shouldDefineZero\nis false, then zero\nshould never be defined, since the block never executes. However, historically, this was left unspecified, so different browsers implemented it differently in non-strict mode. For more information, see the function\ndeclaration reference.\nA safer way to define functions conditionally is to assign a function expression to a variable:\n// Using a var makes it available as a global variable,\n// with closer behavior to a top-level function declaration\nvar zero;\nif (shouldDefineZero) {\nzero = function () {\nconsole.log(\"This is zero.\");\n};\n}\nExamples\n>Returning a formatted number\nThe following function returns a string containing the formatted representation of a number padded with leading zeros.\n// This function returns a string padded with leading zeros\nfunction padZeros(num, totalLen) {\nlet numStr = num.toString(); // Initialize return value as string\nconst numZeros = totalLen - numStr.length; // Calculate no. of zeros\nfor (let i = 1; i <= numZeros; i++) {\nnumStr = `0${numStr}`;\n}\nreturn numStr;\n}\nThe following statements call the padZeros\nfunction.\nlet result;\nresult = padZeros(42, 4); // returns \"0042\"\nresult = padZeros(42, 2); // returns \"42\"\nresult = padZeros(5, 4); // returns \"0005\"\nDetermining whether a function exists\nYou can determine whether a function exists by using the typeof\noperator. In the following example, a test is performed to determine if the window\nobject has a property called noFunc\nthat is a function. If so, it is used; otherwise, some other action is taken.\nif (typeof window.noFunc === \"function\") {\n// use noFunc()\n} else {\n// do something else\n}\nNote that in the if\ntest, a reference to noFunc\nis used â there are no parentheses ()\nafter the function name so the actual function is not called.\nSpecifications\n| Specification |\n|---|\n| ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification> # sec-function-definitions> |"}
